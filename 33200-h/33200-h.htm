<h2>WHENCE AND WHY</h2>
</div>
<p>The chapters of this book were originally
articles in <i>Everybody&#8217;s Magazine</i>. I have
not embellished them with footnotes nor given
them any other part of the panoply of critical
apparatus. It could be done. I have preferred
to leave them in the dress I first gave them,&mdash;a
fighting dress. They owe much of their structure,
it is true, to facts and ideas out of the dust
of libraries. But they owe much more to facts
and ideas exhumed out of the much more neglected
dust of daily circumstance. Either dust,
by itself, is lifeless. When the two cohere they
establish the current of existence. At their
meeting-place this book has tried to stand. And
so, while it hopes to have added to knowledge,
it will have failed unless it has merged into
conduct.</p>
<p>The reader will forgive the abruptness of the
shift of attention from the subject of one chapter
to the subject of the next. Each chapter,
because of having been a separate magazine
article, is still an isolated unit. Its isolation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_viii' name='page_viii'></a>viii</span>
however, is only that of form. In thought there
is a sequence both logical and temporal.</p>
<p>Devoting themselves to five critical phases in
the mental development of the modern woman,
the five chapters of this book accompany her
through five successive stages in her personal
life. The postponement of marriage, the preliminary
period of self-support, the new training
for motherhood, the problem of leisure, the
opportunity for civic service,&mdash;these subjects,
treated in turn, follow one another in the order
of their appearance in a normal life-history.
They are further unified by the proof (I hope
it is proof) throughout adduced that even the
most diverse of the phenomena observed, the
female parasite equally with the female suffragist,
the domestic-science-and-art enthusiast
equally with the economic-independence enthusiast,
are all of them products of the one same
big industrial unfoldment which is exposing all
women, willing or unwilling, to the winds of the
social process, which is giving to all women,
whether home-keepers or wanderers, in place of
the old home-world, the new world-home.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p>The woman of to-morrow will not differ
from the woman of yesterday in femininity or
physique or capacity, in her charm for men, or
her love of children, but in the response of her
eternally feminine nature to a changed environment.
The environment is bound to alter the
superficial characteristics of woman as every
change has done. Man, in his turn, will be a
beneficiary of this new womanliness as he has
been the ready victim of the old-womanishness.</p>
<p>The reader will find in this book a dramatic
picture of the gap between girlhood and motherhood
which causes both girls and men to go
wrong, and which can only be filled adequately
by work&mdash;work even more suitably performed
after marriage than before. Postponed childbearing,
if not postponed marriage, is justified
by the superiority of the younger children or
the children of older parents. A declining birth
rate may be redeemed by a declining death rate
and the superior progeny of mature marriage.</p>
<p>The life of great-grandmamma fills us with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_x' name='page_x'></a>x</span>
wonder and pity. Her labors were legion, and,
while no longer necessary in the house, their
equivalent must be found or girls become parasites.
Notwithstanding her incredible labors
great-grandmamma died young, having sacrificed
herself on the altar of masculine egotism
and prerogative. Her life was a short but not
a merry one, but our virtuous forefather&#8217;s life
was a long and sensual one.</p>
<p>To-day woman is beginning to be educated
for the new era and man must go with her. She
is learning homemaking with new implements
and new opportunities. She need no longer be
a drudge and she must not continue to be a doll.
Since the days of John Ruskin, even the academic
economists have had to put spending
before saving in the logical exposition of their
science,&mdash;consumption and thrift can only be
adjusted by those who work and live. Hence,
the new mother, alert to the larger needs of her
household, is more competent than great-grandmamma
and must even supplant &#8220;the tired
business man&#8221; in municipal housekeeping, until
he can learn to be her equal and himself deserve
the suffrage.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xi' name='page_xi'></a>xi</span></div>
<p>Mr. Hard has produced a brilliant volume,
as might have been expected. Mr. Hard
could write a book in the dark; but it may not
have been known that he could illumine with
such scholarly sagacity the shadows cast on the
woman question by man&#8217;s huge egotism and
woman&#8217;s carefully coddled superstition. Originally
magazine articles, Mr. Hard&#8217;s chapters
are a unit in being sound economics and sociology
on the woman question, but they will probably
not secure him a doctor&#8217;s degree from his
alma mater for they are also humorous, intelligible
and inspiring.</p>

<h2>I.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />Love Deferred</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Mary felt she would wait for John even if,
instead of going away on a career, he
were going away on a comet.</p>
<p>She waited for him from the time she was
twenty-two to the time she was twenty-six, and
would have waited longer if she hadn&#8217;t got angry
and insisted on marrying him.</p>
<p>Into why she waited, and why she wouldn&#8217;t
wait any longer, chance put most of the simple
plot of the commonplace modern drama, &#8220;Love
Deferred.&#8221; It is so commonplace that it is
doubtful if any other drama can so stretch the
nerves or can so draw from them a thin, high
note of fine pain.</p>
<p>We will pretend that John was a doctor. No,
that&#8217;s too professional. He was a civil engineer.
That&#8217;s professional enough and more commercial.
It combines Technique and Business,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
which are the two big elements in the life of
Modern Man.</p>
<p>When they got engaged, Mary was through
college, but John had one more year to go in
engineering school.</p>
<p>How the preparation for life does lengthen
itself out!</p>
<p>When Judge Story was professor at Harvard
in the thirties of the last century, he put the law
into his pupils&#8217; heads in eighteen months. The
present professors require three years.</p>
<p>In 1870 the Harvard Medical School made
you attend classes for four months in each of
three years. It now makes you do it for nine
months in each of four years.</p>
<p>As for engineering, the University of Wisconsin
gave John a chill by informing him in its
catalogue that &#8220;it is coming to be generally recognized
that a four-year technical course following
the high-school course is not an adequate
preparation for those who are to fill important
positions; and the University would urge all
those who can afford the time to extend their
studies over a period of five or six years.&#8221;</p>
<p>John compromised on five. This gave him a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
few Business courses in the College of Commerce
in addition to his regular Technique
courses in the College of Engineering. He was
now a Bachelor of Science.</p>
<p>He thereupon became an apprentice in the
shops of one of the two biggest electrical firms in
the United States. He inspected the assembling
of machines before they were shipped, and he
overheard wisdom from foremen and superintendents.
His salary was fifteen cents an hour.
Since he worked about ten hours a day, his total
income was about forty dollars a month. At the
end of the year he was raised to fifty. This was
the normal raise for a Bachelor of Science.</p>
<p>The graduates of Yale and Harvard in the
bright colonial days of those institutions married
almost immediately on graduation. John
didn&#8217;t. He didn&#8217;t get married so early nor become
a widower so often. He didn&#8217;t carry so
many children to the christening font nor so
many to the cemetery.</p>
<p>Look at the dark as well as the bright side of
colonial days.</p>
<p>Pick out any of the early Harvard classes.
Honestly and truly at random, run your finger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
down the column and pick any class. The class
of 1671!</p>
<p>It had eleven graduates. One of them remained
a bachelor. Don&#8217;t be too severe on him.
He died at twenty-four. Of the remaining ten,
four were married twice and two were married
three times. For ten husbands, therefore, there
were eighteen wives.</p>
<p>Mr. G. Stanley Hall, President of Clark University,
very competently remarks: &#8220;The problem
of superfluous women did not exist in those
days. They were all needed to bring up another
woman&#8217;s children.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ten husbands of the Harvard class of
1671, with their eighteen wives, had seventy-one
children. They did replenish the earth. They
also filled the churchyards.</p>
<p><i>Twenty-one of those seventy-one children died
in childhood.</i></p>
<p>This left fifty to grow up. It was an average
of five surviving children for each of the ten
fathers. But it was an average of only 2.7 for
each of the eighteen mothers.</p>
<p>In commending the colonial family one must
make an offset for the unfair frequency with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
which it had more than one wife-and-mother to
help out its fertility record. And in commending
the era of young wives and numerous children
one must make an offset for the hideous frequency
with which it killed them.</p>
<p>Turn from Harvard to Yale. Look at the
men who graduated from 1701 to 1745.</p>
<p>The girls they took in marriage were most
of them under twenty-one and were many of
them down in their &#8217;teens, sometimes as far down
as fourteen.</p>
<p>May we observe that they were not taken in
marriage out of a conscious sense of duty to the
Commonwealth and to Population? They were
taken because they were needed. The colonial
gentleman had to have his soap kettles and candle
molds and looms and smokehouses and salting
tubs and spinning wheels and other industrial
machines operated for him by somebody, if
he was going to get his food and clothes and
other necessaries cheap. He lost money if he
wasn&#8217;t domestic. He was domestic.</p>
<p>Our young engineering friend, John, when
<i>he</i> looked forward to <i>his</i> future domestic establishment,
saw no industrial machines in it at all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
except a needle and a saucepan. Consequently
he had very little real use for a wife. What he
wanted was money enough to &#8220;give&#8221; Mary a
home.</p>
<p>Marriages are more uncertain now. And
fewer of them are marriages of mere convenience.
It is both a worse and a better state of
things. On the one hand, John didn&#8217;t marry
Mary so soon. On the other hand, he was prevented
from wanting anything in his marriage
except just Mary.</p>
<p>The enormous utility of the colonial wife,
issuing in enormous toil (complicated by unlimited
childbearing), had this kind of result:</p>
<p>Among the wives of the 418 Yale husbands of
the period from 1701 to 1745, there were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Thirty-three who died before they were
twenty-five years old;</i></p>
<p><i>Fifty-five who died before they were thirty-five
years old;</i></p>
<p><i>Fifty-nine who died before they were forty-five
years old.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those 418 Yale husbands lost 147 wives before
full middle age.</p>
<p>It ceases, therefore, to be surprising, though it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
remains unabatedly sickening, that the stories
of the careers of colonial college men, of the
best-bred men of the times, are filled with such
details as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;First wife died at twenty-four, leaving
six children.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;Eight children born within twelve
years, two of them feeble-minded.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;First wife died at nineteen, leaving
three children.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;Fourteen children. First wife died at
twenty-eight, having borne eight children in ten
years.&#8221;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that age of universal early marrying
and of promiscuous early dying we have come in
two centuries to an age of delayed (and even
omitted) marrying and of a settled determination
to keep on living.</p>
<p>The women&#8217;s colleges are so new and they attracted
in their early days so un-average a sort
of girl that their records are not conclusive.
Nevertheless, here are some guiding facts from
Smith College, of Northampton, Massachusetts:</p>
<p>(We are taking college facts not because this
chapter is confined in any respect to college people,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
but merely because the matrimonial histories
in the records of the colleges are the most
complete we know of.)</p>
<p>In 1888, Smith College, in its first ten classes,
had graduated 370 women.</p>
<p>In 1903, fifteen years later, among those 370
women there were 212 who were still single.</p>
<p>This record does not satisfy Mr. G. Stanley
Hall, who figured it out. The remaining facts,
however, might be considered more cheering:</p>
<p>The 158 Smith women who had married had
borne 315 children. This was two for each of
them. And most of them were still in their
childbearing period. Compare this with the
colonial records. But don&#8217;t take the number of
children per colonial father. Be fair. Take it
per mother.</p>
<p>We have the matrimonial histories of colonial
Yale and Harvard men grouped and averaged
according to the decade in which they were
graduated. We will regard the graduates of
each decade as together constituting one case.</p>
<p>In no case does the average number of children
per wife go higher than 3.89. In one case
it goes as low as 2.98.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>Perhaps the modern wife&#8217;s habit of going on
living and thereby protracting her period of
childbearing will in time cause her fertility record
to compare not unfavorably with that of the
colonial wife, who made an early start but a
quick finish.</p>
<p>In the year 1903, among all the 370 Smith
graduates in those first ten classes, only twenty-four
had died. And among all the 315 children,
only twenty-six had died. On the whole, between
being the wife of a Yale or Harvard colonial
graduate and being a member of one of the
first ten Smith classes, a modern girl might conclude
that the chances of being a dead one matrimonially
in the latter case would be more than
offset by the chances of being a dead one actually
in the former.</p>
<p>This deplorable flippancy would overlook the
serious fact that permanent or even prolonged
celibacy on the part of large numbers of young
men and young women is a great social evil.
The consequences of that evil we shall observe
later on.<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a></p>
<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0001' id='Footnote_0001'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0001'><span class='label'>[1]</span></a>
<p>In speaking about celibacy we refer wholly to secular
and not at all to religious celibacy.</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>In the meantime we return to John and
Mary.</p>
<p>While John was doing his last year in engineering
school, Mary did a year of technical
study in the New York School of Philanthropy,
or in the St. Louis School of Social Economy, or
in the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy,
or in the Boston School for Social
Workers.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t even let you start in &#8220;doing good&#8221;
nowadays without some training for it. This is
wise, considering how much harm doing good
can do.</p>
<p>But how the preparation for life does lengthen
itself out!</p>
<p>Mary took a civil-service examination and got
a job with the State Bureau of Labor. She finished
her first year with the Bureau at the same
time that John finished his first year with the
electrical firm. She had earned $600. He had
earned $480.</p>
<p>There were several hundred other apprentices
in the shops along with John. When he thought
of the next year&#8217;s work at fifty a month and when
he looked at the horde of competing Bachelors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
of Science in which he was pocketed, he whitened
a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must get out of the ruck,&#8221; he said to himself.
&#8220;I must get a specialty. I must do some
more preparing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He began to perceive how long it takes the
modern man to grow up, intellectually and financially.
He began to perceive what a tedious
road he must travel before he could arrive at
maturity&mdash;and Mary!</p>
<p>But he had pluck. &#8220;I&#8217;ll really prepare,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and then I&#8217;ll really make good.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Western university offered a scholarship of
$500 a year, the holder of which would be free
to devote himself to a certain specified technical
subject. John tried for the scholarship and got
it, and spent a year chasing electrical currents
from the time when they left the wheels of street
cars to the time when they eventually sneaked
back home again into the power house, after
having sported clandestinely along gas mains
and water pipes, biting holes into them as they
went.</p>
<p>It was a good subject, commercially. At the
end of the year he was engaged as engineer by a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
street-car company which was being sued by a
gas company for allowing its current to eat the
gas company&#8217;s property. He was to have a salary
of $1,000 a year. He was going strong.</p>
<p>One thousand dollars! Millions of married
couples live on less than that. But John didn&#8217;t
even think of asking Mary to share it with
him.</p>
<p>Mary, when married, was to be supported in
approximate accordance with the standards of
the people John knew. Every John thinks that
about it, without really thinking about it at all.
It&#8217;s just in him.</p>
<p>It bothered Mary. How much money would
John want to spend on her before he would take
her? It made her feel like a box of candy in a
store window.</p>
<p>Still, a social standard is a fact. Just as much
so as if it could be laid off with a tape. And
there is sense in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; thought Mary, &#8220;if we had only
$1,000 a year we couldn&#8217;t live where any of our
friends do, and John would be cut off from being
on daily intimate terms with people who could
help him; and if we had children&mdash;Well, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
you are! We surely couldn&#8217;t give our children
what <i>our</i> children ought to have. That settles
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The influence of social standards is greatly increased
and complicated in a world in which
women earn their living before marriage and
have a chance to make social standards of their
own in place of the ones they were born to.</p>
<p>We here insert a few notes on cases which are
not compositely imagined&mdash;like Mary and John&mdash;but
are individually (though typically) existent
in real life in one of the large American
cities:</p>
<p>R&mdash;&mdash; J&mdash;&mdash;. Makes $6,500 a year. Only
man she was ever &#8220;real sweet on&#8221; was a teamster.
When she was selling in the perfumes at
five a week he used to take her to the picnics of
the Social Dozen Pleasure Club. They would
practice the Denver Lurch on Professor De
Vere&#8217;s dancing platform. At midnight he
would give her a joy-ride home in his employer&#8217;s
delivery wagon. He still drives that wagon.
She is in charge of suits and costumes and has
several assistant buyers under her. She has
bought a cottage for her father, who is an ingrain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
weaver in a carpet factory. She wears a stick-pin
recently presented to her by her teamster.
&#8220;I like him all right,&#8221; is her notion about it,
&#8220;but I ought to have took him ten years ago.
Now he can&#8217;t support me.&#8221;</p>
<p>S&mdash;&mdash; V&mdash;&mdash;. Makes twelve dollars a week
as a manicurist. Thinks a man ought to have at
least thirty dollars a week before marrying.</p>
<p>T&mdash;&mdash; V&mdash;&mdash;. Sister of S&mdash;&mdash; V&mdash;&mdash;, who
doesn&#8217;t think much of her. She works in a paper-box
factory at five dollars a week and is engaged
to a glove cutter who makes eleven.</p>
<p>T&mdash;&mdash; A&mdash;&mdash;. Saleswoman. Thinks women
ought to be paid as much as men. &#8220;Then they
wouldn&#8217;t be so ready to marry <i>anybody</i>.&#8221; Works
in the cloak department. Is a star. Makes about
eighteen dollars a week. Says that most of the
men she knows who could support her would
certainly get in a terrible row at home if they
married a cloak-department girl. Families are
stuck up. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t care; let it run a while.
Tell you something. I was born in the steerage.
I&#8217;ve been right where the money isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not
taking any chances on getting there again. Let
Georgina do it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>R&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;&mdash;. Sub-bookkeeper. Seven dollars
a week. Engaged to clerk who earns thirteen.
Says: &#8220;Of course I&#8217;m not earning much,
but I&#8217;m living with my folks and when we&#8217;re
married I&#8217;ll have to give up a lot of things.
Kinda wish I hadn&#8217;t got used even to the
seven.&#8221;</p>
<p>This last case, of the bookkeeper engaged to
the clerk, is the modern situation at its happiest
normal. The modern marriage, except among
the rich, is a contraction of resources. It is just
the reverse, in that respect, of the colonial marriage.</p>
<p>The colonial bride, marrying into Industry,
brought her full economic value to her husband.</p>
<p>The modern bride, marrying out of Industry,
leaves most of her economic value behind. And
the greater that value was, the sharper is the
shock of the contraction of resources.</p>
<p>Of course, the case of the department-store
buyer and the teamster is irrelevantly extreme.
But aren&#8217;t there thousands and thousands of cases
which, while less advanced, are pointed in the
same direction? The more a woman earns, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
fewer become the men who can support her.
How can the clerk support the cloak saleswoman
who has had eighteen dollars a week of her own?
How can the barber support the manicurist who
has had twelve?</p>
<p>The cloak saleswoman may talk flippantly
about it, but, at heart, isn&#8217;t she seriously right?
She has pulled herself up to a certain level. Except
in response to a <i>grande passion</i> she will not
again drop below it. She will bring up her children
at a point as close to her present level as she
can. That is instinct.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, she isn&#8217;t married. But what can
you do about it? She went to work, like almost
every other working woman, because she had to.
And you can&#8217;t pass a law prohibiting her from
earning more than five dollars a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all economic,&#8221; thought Mary. &#8220;Nothing
else.&#8221; She had much reason for thinking so.</p>
<p>Did you ever see Meitzen&#8217;s diagram showing
the relation between the price of rye and the
number of marriages in Prussia during a period
of twenty-five years?</p>
<p>Cheap rye, easy living conditions&mdash;number of
marriages rises. Dear rye, hard living conditions&mdash;number
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
of marriages drops. The fluctuations
are strictly proportional. In the twenty-sixth
year, given the price of rye, you could predict
very closely the number of marriages.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like suicides. It&#8217;s the easiest thing in
the world to predict the number of men and
women who will next year &#8220;decide&#8221; to take
their own lives.</p>
<p>The marriage rate responds not only to the
economic conditions of a whole country but to
the economic conditions of its various parts.</p>
<p>You live in Vermont. Very well. Between
the ages of twenty-five and thirty in Vermont,
there will be 279 out of every 1,000 of you who
will still be single.</p>
<p>But you live in the State of New York. Very
well. Between the ages of twenty-five and
thirty there will be 430 of you out of every 1,000
who will still be single.</p>
<p>In Vermont, 279. In New York, 430. A
difference of 151 in every 1,000.</p>
<p>For those 151 persons, is it human volition?
Is it a perverse aversion to the other sex?</p>
<p>Even at that, on the face of it, those who try
to argue New Yorkers into marrying young are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
clearly taking the difficult route to their purpose.
It would be more adroit simply to urge
them to live in Vermont.</p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t the real reason this&mdash;that New York,
with its large cities, is farther removed than
Vermont, with no large cities, from the primitive
industrial conditions of colonial times?</p>
<p>The North Atlantic states, as a whole, are
industrially more advanced than the South Central
states. Compare them in this marriage
matter:</p>
<p>Among all the wives in the South Central
states, there are 543 out of every 1,000 who are
under thirty-five years of age.</p>
<p>Among all the wives in the North Atlantic
states those who are under thirty-five years of
age are, in each 1,000, only 428.</p>
<p>In the South Central states, 543. In the North
Atlantic states, 428. A difference of 115!</p>
<p>Getting married early is imputed unto us for
actual personal righteousness by innumerable
clergymen, essayists, and editorial writers. Are
there so many more righteous women along the
Gulf of Mexico than along the Atlantic Coast?
One hundred and fifteen more out of every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
thousand? We cannot quite credit so great a
discrepancy in relative human virtue.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t escape, in any numbers, from the
law which reigns in your vicinity.</p>
<p>Live on the Gold Coast of Africa. When
you&#8217;re thirteen, if you&#8217;re a girl, they&#8217;ll boil a
yam and mash it and mix it with palm oil and
scatter it on the banks of the stream and wash
you in the stream and streak your body with
white clay in fine lines and lead you down the
street under an umbrella and announce your
readiness to be a bride. Which you will be in
a day or two.</p>
<p>Live in Russia, and if you&#8217;re a girl you&#8217;ll get
married before you&#8217;re twenty in more than fifty
cases out of a hundred. It&#8217;s the most primitive
of civilized countries. It&#8217;s halfway between
Africa and, say, Rhode Island.</p>
<p>These marriages before twenty tend to fall off
rapidly in a rapidly developing industrial region
like Rhode Island.</p>
<p>In 1860 the married persons in Rhode Island
who had married before they were twenty were
twenty-one in every hundred.</p>
<p>In 1900 they were only nine in every hundred.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>A drop from twenty-one to nine in forty years!</p>
<p>And if you can&#8217;t escape, in any numbers, from
the law which reigns in your vicinity, neither
can you escape, in any numbers, from the law
which reigns in your social set.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Bailey&#8217;s book on &#8220;Social Conditions&#8221;:</p>
<p>Live in England and be a girl and belong to
the class of people that miners come from: Your
age at marriage will be, on the average, twenty-two.
But belong to the class of people that professional
men come from: Your age at marriage
will be, on the average, twenty-six.</p>
<p>This difference exists also in the United States.
It is in the direct line of social and economic
development.</p>
<p>The professional man is a farther developed
type of man than the miner. It takes him longer
to get through his educational infancy&mdash;longer
to arrive at his mental and financial maturity.
The professional man&#8217;s wife is a farther developed
type than the miner&#8217;s wife. Her economic
utility as a cook and as a laundress in her husband&#8217;s
house tends to approach zero.</p>
<p>Where these two lines of development, male
and female, come to a meeting point; where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
man&#8217;s infancy is longest and the woman&#8217;s value
as housewife is least;&mdash;<i>there</i> is, necessarily, altogether
apart from personal preferences, the
greatest postponement of marriage.</p>
<p>The United States, except possibly in certain
sections, has not come to the end of its growth
toward postponed marriage.</p>
<p>It is true that in Massachusetts, within the
past forty-five years, the average age of women
at marriage has risen from 20.7 to 24.6. That
is a very &#8220;modern&#8221; and &#8220;developed&#8221; marriage
age. But many of the older countries surpass
it. In Belgium, for instance, which is a most
intensely industrialized country, the average age
of women at marriage is 28.19.</p>
<p>It is hard, indeed, to look at the advancing
marriage age and to compare its varying rate
of progress in different continents, different
countries, different localities, and different social
circles without admitting that, whatever
whirling, nebulous mists of personal preferences
it may create and carry with it, its nucleus is
purely economic.</p>
<p>Early marriage was made by economic advantages.
It was destroyed by economic changes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
It will not be restored except by economic adjustments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; said Mary, &#8220;I want John.&#8221;</p>
<p>John had finished being engineer for the electric
railway company.</p>
<p>Out of his two years&#8217; experience he had saved
a few hundred dollars. No, he hadn&#8217;t. That
isn&#8217;t probable. The way he made his start into
the next phase of his career was not by having
any ready money. Having ready money is far
from being characteristic of the young man of
to-day.</p>
<p>John opened his office as a consulting electrical
engineer not on his own resources but as
an agent for an electrical supply company. Being
agent for that company assured him enough
money to pay the office rent and stenographer.
For the rest, for his meals and his bed, he depended
on his clients. Whom he didn&#8217;t have.
But he started out to get them.</p>
<p>He opened his office in the city in which Mary
was.</p>
<p>And then a strange but normal thing occurred.
They spent enough money on theaters
and boat rides and candy in the next three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
months to have paid the rent on a flat. It is
true John&#8217;s net income was too small and uncertain
to have justified the founding of a
family. But it was also true that they spent
every cent they had. The celibate life is an
extravagant life. One of the innumerable
sources of modern extravagance is found just
there.</p>
<p>Mary reflected on it. She didn&#8217;t like it. And
she began to see other things she didn&#8217;t like in
this protraction of the period of singleness.</p>
<p>Her work for the Bureau of Labor had taken
her into many places, among all sorts of women.
She began to observe the irregular living which
is inevitably associated with a system of late
marriages.</p>
<p>Mr. Lester F. Ward has learnedly and elaborately
informed us that if we go back to the
origin of life on this planet we shall find that
the female was the only sex then existent, being
original life itself, reproducing itself by division
of itself, and that the male was created as an
afterthought of nature&#8217;s for the purpose of introducing
greater variation into the development
of living things. The male, to begin with,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
had only one function. That was to be a male.
He was purely a sex-thing.</p>
<p>Whether this biological theory stands or falls,
it is certain that it squares with the present
character of the sexes. The sex which originated
as a sex-thing remains the more actively
sexed.</p>
<p>There was once a very good sociologist called
Robert Louis Stevenson who made many researches
into the psychology of the human race.
While on his &#8220;Inland Voyage&#8221; he observed in
this matter that &#8220;it is no use for a man to take
to the woods; we know him; Anthony tried the
same thing long ago and had a pitiful time of
it by all accounts. But there is this about some
women, that they suffice to themselves and can
walk in a high and cold zone without the countenance
of any trousered being.&#8221;</p>
<p>The celibate life is more possible for most
of them by nature. If it were not for that fact,
the postponement of marriage would by this
time have demolished the ethical code.</p>
<p>Even as things stand, Mary was quite willing
to admit, when she saw it, that there are two
kinds of women greatly increasing in modern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
days. Both have always existed, but now they
are increasing very rapidly and in parallel lines
of corresponding development.</p>
<p>In one column is the enormous army of young
women who remain unmarried till twenty-five,
till thirty, till thirty-five. Even at that last
age, and beyond it, in a well-developed city like,
say, Providence,&nbsp;R.I., in the age period from
thirty-five to forty-five, twenty out of every hundred
women are still single.</p>
<p>In the other column is the enormous army of
young women who, outside of the marriage relation
altogether, lead a professional sex life,
venal, furtive, ignoble, and debasing; an army
which has existed since the beginning of time
but which every postponement of the age of
marriage causes to increase in relative numbers
and to gain new strength for poisoning the blood
of life.</p>
<p>Love, denied at the front door, flies in by the
cellar window. Angel or bat, it is always with
us. Our only choice is between its guises.</p>
<p>Mary looked at the army of women celibates
in offices and in stores and in their apartments
and in their boarding houses, women celibates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
five and ten and fifteen and twenty years into
the period when nature has by irrepealable
edict ordained love. It was surely unnatural,
for the mass of them. They were not vowed
nuns. They were not devoted to any great
cause. They were just ordinary, normal young
women, thousands and thousands and thousands
and thousands of them.</p>
<p>Then, on the other side, Mary looked at the
great army of women in the midnight restaurants,
in the streets, in their segregated quarters&mdash;women
who, however they may be sentimentalized
about and however irresponsible they
may be for their own condition, are, as a matter
of fact, ignorant, stupid, silly, and dirty. Yet
on them was squandered the emotional life of
millions of young men.</p>
<p>On the one side&mdash;intelligent, capable, effective
young women, leading lives of emotional
sterility. On the other side&mdash;inferior women
blasted and withered by their specialization in
the emotional life of youth!</p>
<p>The connection between postponement of marriage
and irregularity of living will be admitted
by everybody who is willing to face facts and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
who is optimist enough to believe that if, instead
of letting facts sleep, we rouse them and
fight them we can make a better race.</p>
<p>The great Russian scientist, Metchnikoff, successor
to Pasteur in the Pasteur Institute, mentions
the postponement of marriage as one of
the biological disharmonies of life. It is a disharmony
that &#8220;among highly civilized peoples
marriage and <i>regular</i> unions are impossible at
the <i>right time</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Mr. A. S. Johnson, writing in the authoritative
report of the committee of fifteen on
the social evil, notes the parallel increase of
&#8220;young unmarried men&#8221; and of a city&#8217;s &#8220;volume
of vice.&#8221;</p>
<p>He goes on to make, without comment, a statement
of the economic facts of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a rule,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the income which a
young man earns, while sufficient to secure a
fair degree of comfort for himself, does not suffice
for founding a family.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cannot found a family at the <i>right</i> time.
He goes unmarried through the romantic period
of his development, when the senses are at their
keenest and when the other sex, in its most vividly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
idealized perfection, is most poignantly
desired.</p>
<p>Then, later on, he may begin to get a larger
income. Then marriage may become more feasible.
But then romance is waning. Then, as
Mr. Johnson says, &#8220;his standard of personal
comfort rises.&#8221; Romance has been succeeded by
calculation. &#8220;Accordingly he postpones marriage
to a date in the indefinite future or abandons
expectation of it altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>Celibacy through the age of romance! It&#8217;s
emotionally wrong. Sexlessness for a score of
years after sex has awakened! It&#8217;s biologically
wrong. It&#8217;s a defiance of nature. And nature
responds, as she does to every defiance, with a
scourge of physical and social ills.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what of all that?&#8221; thought Mary.
&#8220;Those things are just observations. What I
am going to act on is that I want John.&#8221;</p>
<p>At which point she stopped being a typical
modern young woman.</p>
<p><i>She became a woman of the future.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; she said to John, &#8220;I&#8217;m working.
You&#8217;re working. We&#8217;re single. Very
well. We&#8217;ll change it. I&#8217;m working. You&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
working. We&#8217;re married. Have we lost anything?
And we&#8217;ve gained each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were married and Mary kept on
working.</p>
<p>Two years later she stopped working.</p>
<p>In those two years she had helped John to
start a home. She couldn&#8217;t operate soap kettles
and candle molds and looms and smokehouses
and salting tubs and spinning wheels for him.
But she brought him an equivalent of it in
money. She earned from $900 to $1,000 a year.</p>
<p>Being married, they were more thrifty. They
saved a large part of her earnings. John was
still spending a large part of his on extending
his business, on traveling, on entertaining prospective
clients, on making acquaintances. Sometimes
she had to contribute some of her own
money to his expense accounts. That was the
fortune of war. She helped him pursue success.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give up the memory of those two
years,&#8221; Mary used to say, as she sat and stitched
for her children, &#8220;for anything. I shared at
least a part of my husband&#8217;s youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>By sharing it, she won a certain happiness
otherwise unattainable. They had come to know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
each other and to help form each other&#8217;s character
and to share each other&#8217;s difficulties in
the years when only there is real joy in the struggle
of life. They had not postponed their love
till, with a settled income, John could support
her in comfort and they could look back like
Browning&#8217;s middle-aged estranged lovers to say:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;We have not sighed deep, laughed free,</p>
<p>Starved, feasted, despaired&mdash;been happy.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;It used to take two to start a home in colonial
days,&#8221; Mary would say. &#8220;I am really an old-fashioned
woman. I helped to make this home.
We had twelve hundred dollars in the bank
when I stopped working, and John was pretty
well established.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t regret it,&#8221; she went on, still speaking
as a woman of the future, &#8220;even for the children.
Of course I do wish we had started earlier.
But I would have wanted to wait a while
for the children in any case. People risk too
much when they start a family before they
become sufficiently used to marriage and to
each other to know that they can keep on loving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
each other and to know that they have in
them through their mutual, continued happiness
the power to make a happy home, a noble home,
for children to live in.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the number of children she will have&mdash;we
reserve that subject for future discussion.
We call attention here only to this:</p>
<p>That the facts which were cited from the
Smith College records are harmonious with
many other facts and records tending to show
that the fertility of the modern wife has been
considerably underrated, just as the fertility of
the colonial wife has been considerably exaggerated.</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>That Mary got to her childbearing period
sooner than she would have if she hadn&#8217;t insisted
on marrying John before he was ready
to support her. Those two years would have
been childless years in any case. But they would
probably, if it hadn&#8217;t been for Mary&#8217;s money,
have been lengthened into four or five.</p>
<p>Of course, later marriages in themselves tend
to reduce the number of children. As to quality,
however, the evidence is not clear. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
is even some reason to think that a moderate
postponement is conducive to an improvement
in quality.</p>
<p>Did you ever read Havelock Ellis&#8217;s book
called &#8220;A Study of British Genius&#8221;?</p>
<p>He made a list of the most distinguished of
eminent British persons and studied everything
about them, from their religious opinions to the
color of their hair.</p>
<p>In the matter of the age of their parents, he
finds that the average age of the father at the
birth of the person of genius was thirty-seven
years, while the average of the mother was
thirty-one. His conclusion is: &#8220;On the whole
it would appear, so far as the evidence goes,
that the fathers of our eminent persons have been
predominantly middle-aged and to a marked extent
elderly at the time of the distinguished son&#8217;s
birth; while the mothers have been predominantly
at the period of greatest vigor and maturity
and to a somewhat unusual extent elderly.
There has been a notable deficiency of young
fathers and, still more notably, of young mothers.&#8221;</p>
<p>And did you ever see the study which Mr. R.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
S. Holway made for the Department of Education
of Leland Stanford University on &#8220;The
Age of Parents: Its Effects upon Children&#8221;?
His conclusions are:</p>
<p>&#8220;In most physical qualities the children of
mature parents tend to come out best.</p>
<p>&#8220;In mental ability the children of young
parents show best at an early age but rapidly
lose their precocity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The elder children who show best tend to
be the children of mature and old parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;The children of elderly mothers show a tendency
to superiority throughout.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary did not know about all this, but she
had a very strong opinion to the effect that, in
so far as the quality of her children could be
affected by their home training, she was glad
she had spent at least a few years earning her
living.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every woman,&#8221; said Mary, &#8220;ought to have
some little time for developing into an individual.
Home won&#8217;t do it altogether. Not nowadays.
The colonial home did, being part of
the working world. But what is the modern
home? It is a nest, an eddy, a shelf, a nook.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
It&#8217;s something apart from the world. If a woman
is going to prepare her son for a knowledge
of the real world, if she&#8217;s going to be able to
give him a training which has in it an understanding
and an appreciation of the real world,
if she&#8217;s going to be able to educate him into real
living, she must nowadays and increasingly in
the future have some experience of her own on
her own account in the real world before she
becomes a mother. There&#8217;s no getting away
from that. A reasonable postponement of motherhood
till the future mother becomes a competent
individual will hereafter be urged, not
opposed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble about that,&#8221; said John, &#8220;is that
it makes you too independent of me. Your
proposition is to start in and earn your living
till you&#8217;re pretty good at it. That is, you
wouldn&#8217;t marry me till you were sure you could
chuck me. How about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it has that side. But it has its other
side, too.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t there, after all, something rather pleasant
for John in knowing, <i>knowing</i>, that Mary
isn&#8217;t cleaving unto him simply because she can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
shift for herself? Something exquisitely gratifying
in being certain, <i>certain</i>, that it isn&#8217;t just
necessity that keeps her a home woman?</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were a man living in wedlock,&#8221; said
Mary, &#8220;I should want the door of the cage
always wide open, with my mate fluttering
straight by it every minute to still nestle by me.
And I should want her wings to be strong, and
I should want her to know that if she went
through the door she could fly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For keeping her,&#8221; Mary went on, &#8220;I should
want to trust to my own wings and not to bars.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; said Mary, looking farther into
the future, &#8220;the process isn&#8217;t complete. Freedom
is not yet completely acquired. Children!
We want them! We must have them! Yet how
often they tie us to unions which have come to
be unholy, vile, full of all uncleanness. Women
will never be completely free till, besides being
able to earn their bread when they are <i>not</i>
bearing children, they are relieved of dependence
on the individual character of another
human person while they <i>are</i>. Mr. H. G. Wells
is clearly right about it. When women bear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
children they perform a service to the state.
Children are important to the state. They are
its future life. To leave them to the eccentricities
of the economic fate of the father is ridiculous.
The woman who is bringing up children
should receive from the state the equivalent
of her service in a regular income. Then, and
then only, in the union of man and woman, will
love and money reach their right relationship&mdash;love
a necessity, money a welcome romance!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s remote, very remote,&#8221; concluded Mary.
&#8220;And we can&#8217;t dream it out in detail. But when
it comes it won&#8217;t come out of personal sentiment.
It will come because of being demanded by the
economic welfare of the community. It will
come because it is the best way to get serviceable
children for the state. It will come because,
after all, it is the final answer to the postponement
of marriage.&#8221;</p>

<h2>II.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />Learning for Earning</span></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Every Jack has his Jill.&#8221; It is a tender
twilight thought, and it more or less settles
Jill.</p>
<p>When the census man was at work in 1900,
however, he went about and counted 2,260,000
American women who were more than twenty-five
years old and who were still unmarried.</p>
<p>It is getting worse (or better) with every
passing decade, and out of it is emerging a new
ideal of education for women, an ideal which
seems certain to penetrate the whole educational
system of the United States, all the way from
the elementary schools to the universities.</p>
<p>The census man groups us into age-periods.
The period from twenty-five to twenty-nine is
the most important matrimonially, because it is
the one in which most of us get pretty well fixed
into our life work. Out of every 1,000 women
in that period, in the year 1890, the census man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
found 254 who were still unmarried. <i>In 1900,
only ten years later, he found 275.</i></p>
<p>There is not so much <i>processional</i> as <i>recessional</i>
about marriage at present. In navigating
the stormy waters of life in the realistic pages
of the census reports, it is not till we reach the
comparatively serene, landlocked years from
forty-five to fifty-four that we find ourselves in
an age period in which the number of single
women has been reduced to less than ten per
cent of the total.</p>
<p>The rebound from this fact hits education
hard. As marriage recedes, and as the period
of gainful work before marriage lengthens, the
need of real preparation for that gainful work
becomes steadily more urgent, and the United
States moves steadily onward into an era of
trained women as well as of trained men.</p>

SIMMONS COLLEGE, BOSTON, WHICH HAS FOUR-YEAR COURSES IN SECRETARIAL STUDIES, LIBRARY WORK, SCIENCE, AND HOUSEHOLD ECONOMICS.<br />
<br />
<span class='smaller'><i>Photograph by Baer</i></span><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>In Boston, at that big new college called Simmons&mdash;the
first of its kind in the United States&mdash;a
regular four-year college of which the aim
is to send out every graduate technically trained
to earn her living in some certain specific occupation&mdash;in
Simmons there were enrolled last
year, besides five hundred undergraduate women,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
at least eighty other women who had already
earned their bachelor&#8217;s degrees at other colleges,
such as Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, Smith, Vassar,
Radcliffe, Leland Stanford, and the University
of Montana.</p>
<p>These eighty other women, after eight years
in grammar school, four years in high school,
and four years in college, were taking one year
more in technical school in order to be&mdash;what?
Not doctors or lawyers or architects. Not anything
in the old &#8220;learned&#8221; professions. Their
scholastic purpose was more modest than that.
Yet, modest as it was, it was keeping them on the
learner&#8217;s bench longer than a &#8220;learned&#8221; profession
would have kept most of their grandfathers.
<i>These eighty women were taking graduate
courses in order to be &#8220;social workers&#8221; in settlements
or for charity societies, in order to be library
assistants, in order to be stenographers and
secretaries.</i></p>
<p>The Bachelor of Arts from Vassar who is
going to be a stenographer, and who is taking
her year of graduate study at Simmons, will go
to work at the end of the year and then, six
months later, if she has made good, will get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
from Simmons the degree of Bachelor of
Science. At that point in her life she will have
two degrees and seventeen years of schooling
behind her. A big background. But we are
beginning to do some training for almost everything.</p>
<p>Did you ever see a school of salesmanship for
department-store women employees? You can
see one at the Women&#8217;s Educational and Industrial
Union in Boston. Under the guidance of
Mrs. Lucinda W. Prince, the big department
stores of Boston have come to think enough of
this school to send girls to it every morning and
to pay them full wages while they take a three
months&#8217; course.</p>
<p>If you will attend any of the classes, in arithmetic,
in textiles, in hygiene, in color and design,
in demonstration sales, in business forms,
you will get not only a new view of the art of
selling goods over the counter but a new vision
of a big principle in education.</p>
<p>In the class on color, for instance, you will at
first be puzzled by the vivid interest taken by
the pupils in the <i>theory</i> of color. You have never
before observed in any classroom so intimate a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
concern about rainbows, prisms, spectra, and
the scientific sources of &#230;sthetic effects. Your
mind runs back to your college days and returns
almost alarmed to this unacademic display
of genuine, spontaneous, unanimous enthusiasm.
At last the reason for it works into your
mind. These girls are engaged in the <i>practice</i>
of color every afternoon, over hats, ribbons,
waists, gloves, costumes. When you begin once
to <i>study</i> a subject which reaches practice in your
life, you cannot stop with practice. A law of
your mind carries you on to the theory, the philosophy,
of it.</p>
<p>Just there you see the reason why trade
training, broadly contrived, broadens not only
technique but soul, trains not only to <i>earn</i> but
to <i>live</i>. &#8220;Refined selling&#8221; some of the girls
call the salesmanship which they learn in Mrs.
Prince&#8217;s class. They have perceived, to some
extent, the relation between the arts and sciences
on the one hand and their daily work on the
other.</p>
<p>To a much greater extent has this relation
been perceived by the young woman who has
taken the full four-year course in, say, &#8220;Secretarial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Studies&#8221; in Simmons and who, throughout
her English, her German, her French, her
sociology, and her history, as well as throughout
her typewriting, her shorthand, and her
commercial law, has necessarily kept in view,
irradiating every subject, the beacon-light of
her future working career.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! There, precisely, is the danger. Every
Jack should have his Jill; but if every Jill has
her job, why, there again the wedding day goes
receding some more into the future. Let them
stop all this foolishness and get married, as their
grandparents did!&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Jack! Poor Jill! We lecture them, all
the time, for postponing their marriage. We
ought not to stop there. We ought to go on to
lecture them for doing the thing which makes
them postpone their marriage. We ought to lecture
them for postponing their <i>maturity</i>. We
ought to lecture them for prolonging their mental
and financial infancy.</p>
<p>The big, impersonal, unlectureable industrial
reasons for the modern prolongation of infancy
were glanced at in chapter one of this book. In
the present chapter we shall glance at them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
again, more closely. Just now, however, for
a moment, we must revert to the Census, and we
must take one final look at the amount of
marriage-postponement now existing in this
country.</p>
<p>It was in the United States as a whole that
the census man found 275 out of every 1,000
women in the twenty-five-to-twenty-nine age-period
unmarried. But the United States consists
of developed and of undeveloped regions.
The cities are the high points of development.
Look at the cities:</p>
<p>In Chicago, out of every 1,000 women in the
age-period from twenty-five to twenty-nine,
there were 314 who were unmarried. In Denver
there were 331. In Manhattan and the
Bronx there were 356. In Minneapolis there
were 369. In Philadelphia there were 387.</p>
<p>Southern New England, however, is the most
industrially developed part of the United States,
the part in which social conditions like those of
the older countries of the world are most nearly
reached.</p>
<p>In Fall River, out of every 1,000 women in
the twenty-five-to-twenty-nine age-period, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
unmarried were 391. In New Haven they were
393. In Boston they were 452.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p>If, in educating girls, we educate them only
for the probability of ultimate marriage and not
also for the probability of protracted singleness,
we are doing them a demonstrably grievous
wrong.</p>
<p>But how is their singleness occupied?</p>
<p>We all know now that to a greater and greater
degree it is getting occupied with work, money-earning
work.</p>
<p>The unmarried women in the twenty-five-to-twenty-nine
age-period constitute more than
one-fourth of the total number of women in that
age-period in the United States. In the large
cities they constitute usually more than one-third
of the total number of women in that period.
Wouldn&#8217;t it have been remarkable if their
families had been able to support them all at
home? Wouldn&#8217;t it have been remarkable if
the human race had been able to carry so large
a part of itself on its back?</p>
<p>We now admit the world&#8217;s need of the labor-power
of women. If women aren&#8217;t laboring at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
home (at cooking, laundering, nursing, mothering,
<i>something</i>), they will be (or ought to be)
laboring elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the smaller cities and country districts of
America home-life is still (by comparison)
quite ample in the opportunities it offers the
unmarried daughter for participation in hard
labor. Nevertheless the Census finds that the
percentage of women &#8220;breadwinners&#8221; in the
&#8220;smaller cities and country districts&#8221; is as follows:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Small City Breadwinners">
<tr><td align="center"><i>Age-Periods</i></td><td align="center"><i>Breadwinners</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>From <i>16</i> to <i>20</i> years of age</td><td><i>27</i> women out of every 100</td></tr>
<tr><td>From <i>21</i> to <i>24</i> years of age</td><td><i>26</i> women out of every 100</td></tr>
<tr><td>From <i>25</i> to <i>34</i> years of age</td><td><i>17</i> women out of every 100</td></tr>
</table>
<p>&#8220;Smaller cities,&#8221; to the Census, means cities
having fewer than 50,000 inhabitants. In the
larger cities, in the cities which have <i>more</i>
than 50,000 inhabitants, in the urban environment
in which home-life tends most to contract
to an all-modern-conveniences size, in the urban
environment in which the domestic usefulness
of unmarried daughters tends most to contract
to the dimensions of &#8220;sympathy&#8221; and &#8220;companionship,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
the Census finds that the percentage
of women breadwinners is as follows:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Urban Breadwinners">
<tr><td align="center"><i>Age-Periods</i></td><td align="center"><i>Breadwinners</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>From <i>16</i> to <i>20</i> years of age</td><td><i>52</i> women out of every 100</td></tr>
<tr><td>From <i>21</i> to <i>24</i> years of age</td><td><i>45</i> women out of every 100</td></tr>
<tr><td>From <i>25</i> to <i>34</i> years of age</td><td><i>27</i> women out of every 100</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p>If, in educating girls, we do not educate them
for the <i>possibility</i> of money-earning work, we
are exposing them to the possibility of having to
do that work without being schooled to it; we
are exposing them to the possibility of having to
take the first job they see, of having to do <i>almost
anything</i> for <i>almost nothing</i>; we are doing them
a wrong so demonstrable and so grievous that it
cannot continue.</p>
<p>The schools which give a direct preparation
for industrial life are growing fast.</p>
<p>In the Manhattan Trade School for Girls, in
New York City, many hundreds of young girls
are, in each year, enrolled. These girls have
completed the first five public-school grades.
They are learning now to be workers in paste
and glue for such occupations as sample-mounting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
and candle-shade-making, to be workers
with brush and pencil for such occupations as
photograph-retouching and costume-sketching,
to be milliners, to be dressmakers, to be operators
of electric-power sewing-machines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to it,&#8221; says an irritated manufacturer.
&#8220;Nothing to it at all. I can&#8217;t get any
good help any more. Back to the old days!
Those early New Englanders who made the
business of this country what it is, they didn&#8217;t
have all this technical business. They didn&#8217;t
study in trade schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>My dear sir, those early New Englanders not
only studied in trade schools, but worked and
played and slept in trade schools. They spent
their whole lives in trade schools, from the moment
when they began to crawl on the floor
among their mothers&#8217; looms and spinning-wheels.
There were few homes in early New
England that didn&#8217;t offer large numbers of technical
courses in which the father and the mother
were always teaching by doing and the sons
and the daughters were always learning by imitating.</p>
<p>The facts about this are so simple and so familiar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
that we don&#8217;t stop to think of their meaning.</p>
<p>When in the spring the wood ashes from the
winter fires were poured into the lye barrel,
and water was poured in with them, and the lye
began to trickle out from the bottom of the barrel,
and the winter&#8217;s savings of grease were
brought out, and the grease and the lye were
boiled together in the big kettle, and mother
had finished making the family&#8217;s supply of soap
for another year, the children had taken not
only a little lesson in industriousness, by helping
to make the soap, but a little lesson in industry,
too, by observing the technique and organization
of the soap business from start to finish. A
boy from that family, even if he never learned
to read or write the word &#8220;soap,&#8221; might some
day have some <i>ideas</i> about soap.</p>

<p>These departments might give a girl a pretty
fair education of the hand and a pretty fair acquaintance
with the technique and organization
of the working world; but we haven&#8217;t yet mentioned
the biggest and hardest department of all.</p>
<p>Before mentioning it, let us take a look at the
picture reproduced in this chapter from a book
published in the year 1493. This book was a
French translation of Boccaccio&#8217;s collection of
stories called &#8220;Noble Women.&#8221; The picture
shows a woolen mill being operated in the
grounds of a palace by a queen and her ladies-in-waiting.
It summons back the days when
even the daughters of kings and nobles could
not help acquiring a knowledge of the working
world, because they were in it.</p>
<p>One of the ladies-in-waiting is straightening
out the tangled strands of wool with carding
combs. The other has taken the combed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
straightened strands and is spinning them into
yarn. The queen, being the owner of the plant,
has the best job. She is weaving the yarn into
cloth on a loom.</p>

THIS SKETCH OF A WOOLEN MILL OPERATED IN THE GROUNDS OF A PALACE BY A QUEEN AND HER LADIES-IN-WAITING IS TAKEN FROM A VERY OLD FRENCH TRANSLATION OF BOCCACCIO&#8217;S BOOK ON &#8220;NOBLE WOMEN.&#8221; IN THOSE DAYS EVERY HOME WAS A FACTORY AND A TRADE SCHOOL.<br />

<p><span class='nowrap'>The daughters of the</span> Emperor Charlemagne,
who, besides being an emperor, was a very rich
man, learned how to card and spin and weave.
Noble women had to direct all that kind of work
on their estates. They lived in the very midst
of industry, of business.</p>
<p>So it was with those early New England
women. And therefore, whether well-to-do or
indigent, they passed on to their sons as well as
to their daughters a steady daily lesson in the
world&#8217;s work. The most intelligent mother in
the United States to-day, let her be kindergartner
and psychologist and child-study specialist
as much as she pleases, cannot give her children
that broad early view of the organization of life.
The only place where her children can get it
now is the school.</p>
<p>On the first of January of the year 1910 Ella
Flagg Young, superintendent of schools in Chicago,
took algebra out of the eighth grade of the
elementary schools, and, in its place, inserted a
course on Chicago. Large parts of what was
once the home are now spread out through the
community. The new course will teach the
life of the community, its activities and opportunities,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
civic, &#230;sthetic, industrial. Such a
course is nothing but home training for the enlarged
home.</p>
<p>But we must go back for a moment to that
biggest and hardest department of all in the old
homes of New England.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Deceit, weeping, spinning, God hath give</p>
<p>To women kindly that they may live,&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>said Chaucer in a teasing mood.</p>
<p>But spinning was a very small part of the Department
of Textiles. We forbear to dilate on
the courses of instruction which that department
offered. We confine ourselves to observing
that:</p>
<p>First. In the Subdepartment of Flax, after
heckling the flax with combs of increasing
degrees of fineness till the fibers lay pretty
straight, after spinning it into yarn on her spinning
wheel, after reeling the yarn off into
skeins, after &#8220;bucking&#8221; the skeins in hot lye
through many changes of water, and after using
shuttle and loom to weave the stuff into cloth,
the home woman of those days had to accomplish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
some twenty subsequent processes of bucking,
rinsing, possing, drying, and bleaching
before the cloth was ready for use.</p>
<p>Second. In the Subdepartment of Wool, in
addition to being carders, spinners, and weavers,
women were dyers, handling all the color
resources of the times, boiling pokeberries in
alum to get a crimson, using sassafras for a yellow
or an orange, and producing a black by
boiling the fabric with field sorrel and then
boiling it again with logwood and copperas.</p>
<p>We pass over, as trivial, the making of flax
and wool stuffs into articles of actual use. We
say nothing about the transformation of cloth
into clothes, table-covers, napkins; nothing
about the weaving of yarn on little lap looms
into narrow fabrics used for hair laces, glove
ties, belts, garters, and hatbands; nothing about
the incessant knitting of yarn into mittens and
stockings. Those details were for idle moments.</p>
<p>Sweet domestic days, when girls stayed at
home and helped their mothers and let father
support the family!</p>
<p>It seems as if even Rip Van Winkle, in his
most shiftless mood, ought to have been able to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
support a large number of daughters under such
conditions.</p>
<p>Does it astonish you that they matured young?
There, all about them, from babyhood, were the
basic processes by which the world was sheltered,
clothed, and fed. Those processes were
numerous but simple. Boys and girls observed
them, absorbed them, through eyes, through finger-tips,
during all those early years when eyes
and finger-tips are the nourishing points of the
intellect. Does it astonish you that they were
soon ready for the duties of adult life?</p>
<p>John Winthrop, the first governor of Massachusetts
Bay Colony, was married at seventeen.
His parents were not only willing, but aiding
and abetting. They considered him a man.</p>
<p>Mercy Otis, the wife of the patriot, James
Warren, and Abigail Smith, the wife of the
future president, John Adams, both married before
twenty. A study of their lives will show
that at that age they were not only <i>thought</i> to be
grown up but <i>were</i> so.</p>
<p>To-day, in Boston, a woman of twenty is considered
so immature that many of the hospitals
will not admit her even to her preliminary training
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
for the trade of nurse till she has added at
least three years more to her mental development.</p>
<p>Who has thus prolonged infancy? Who has
thus postponed maturity?</p>
<p>Science has done part of it.</p>
<p>By the invention of power-driven machines
and by the distribution of the compact industries
of the home out and into the scattered, innumerable
business enterprises of the community,
Science has given us, in place of a simple and
near world, a complicated and distant one. It
takes us longer to learn it.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, by research and also by the
use of the printing-press, the locomotive, and
the telegraph wire (which speed up the production
as well as the dissemination of knowledge),
Science has brought forth, in every field
of human interest and of human value, a mass
of facts and of principles so enormous and so
important that the labors of our predecessors on
this planet overwhelm us, and we grow to our
full physical development long before we have
caught up with the previous mental experience
of the race. This is true first with regard to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
what is commonly called General Culture and
next with regard to what is commonly called
Specialization. Growth into General Culture
takes longer and longer. And then so does the
specialized mastery of a specialized technique.
The high-school teacher must not only go to college
but must do graduate work. The young
doctor, after he finishes college and medical
school, is found as an interne in hospitals, as an
assistant to specialists, as a traveler through
European lecture rooms. The young engineer,
the young architect, the young specialist of every
sort, finds his period of preparation steadily extending
before him.</p>
<p>A complicated and distant world instead of a
simple and near one, a large mass of human experience
to assimilate instead of a small one, a
long technique to master instead of a short
one,&mdash;for all this part of the extension of immaturity
we may thank Science. For the remaining
part of it we may thank System.</p>
<p>The world is getting organized. Except in
some of the professions (and often even in them)
we most of us start in on our life work at some
small subdivided job in a large organization of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
people. The work of the organization is so systematized
as to concentrate responsibility&mdash;and
remuneration&mdash;toward the top. In time, from
job to job, up an ascent which grows longer as
the organization grows bigger, we achieve responsibility.
Till we do, we discharge minor
duties for minimum pay.</p>
<p>Thus the <i>mental</i> immaturity resulting from
Science is supplemented by the <i>financial</i> immaturity
resulting from System.</p>
<p>Both kinds of immaturity last longest among
the boys and girls who come from that large section
of society which is neither rich nor poor.</p>
<p>This is not to say that rich and poor escape unaffected.
Shall we ever again, from the most
favored of homes, see a William Pitt, Chancellor
of the Exchequer, by merit, at 23? And, in
the mass of the people, shall we ever again see
that quickness of development toward adulthood
which gave us the old common-law rule
validating the marriage of a male at 14 and of a
female at 12? The retardation of adulthood is
observable in all social groups. But it comes
to its climax in what is commonly called the
&#8220;middle&#8221; group. For it is in that group that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
the passion for education is strongest, or, at any
rate, most effective. It is from the families of
average farmers, of average business men and
of average professional men that we get our big
supply of pupils for the most prolonged technical
training of our schools and universities.</p>
<p>In this matter, as in many other matters, the
historian of the nineteenth century may possibly
find that while public attention was being given
principally to the misery of the poor and to the
luxury of the rich it was in the &#8220;middle&#8221; part
of society that the really revolutionary changes
in family life were happening.</p>
<p>It is with the financial reason for prolonged
immaturity just as it is with the mental. The
rich boy may be supported into marriage by his
family. The son of the laborer soon reaches the
wage-earning level of his environment. But the
son of the average man of moderate means, after
his years of scholastic preparation, must spend
yet other years in a slow climb out of the ranks
into a position of commercial or professional
promise of &#8220;success&#8221; before he acquires what
is regarded in <i>his</i> environment as a marrying
income.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>They say that college girls marry late. It&#8217;s
true enough. But it&#8217;s not well put.</p>
<p>The girls in the social group from which most
college girls are drawn marry late.</p>
<p>Late marriage was not started by college. It
would be safer to say that college was started by
late marriage.</p>
<p>Out of the prolongation of infancy, out of the
postponement of marriage, came the conquest
by women of the intellectual freedom of the
world.</p>
<p>We can learn something about the nature of
education by following the history of that conquest.</p>
<p>When the old New England homestead furnished
adequate employment to all its daughters,
and when those daughters passed directly
from girlhood to wifehood and were still most
adequately employed, there was really little reason
why they should attend the schools in which
their brothers were being taught the knowledges
of the outside world. The girls did not belong
to the outside world. Nor did the outside world
have anything to teach them about their work
in the household.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>In such circumstances it is hardly surprising
that in 1684 the New Haven Grammar School
should have ordered that &#8220;all girls be excluded
as improper and inconsistent with such a grammar
school as the law enjoins.&#8221;</p>
<p>In proportion, however, as the work of the
household was shifted out into the outside world,
and in proportion as women began to follow
that work out into the outside world, the knowledges
of the outside world became appropriate
and necessary for them. Hence, a hundred
years later, in 1790, it was as much a changing
industrial condition as a changing psychological
one which caused the school authorities of
Gloucester, Mass., to resolve that &#8220;two hours
(in each school-day) be devoted to the instruction
of females, as they are a tender and interesting
branch of the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>But grammar-school education, even high-school
education, was not long enough for the
women in the families in which the prolongation
of infancy, and the consequent postponement
of marriage, was greatest. While their
future husbands were going through the long
process of education in school and college and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
university and then through the long process of
commercial and professional apprenticeship,
these girls were passing through the grammar-school
age, through the high-school age, and
then on into what in those days looked like old-maidhood.
Their social environment did not
lead them into factory work. Yet their families
were not rich. How were they to be occupied?</p>
<p>The father of Frederick the Great used to
go about his realm with a stick, and when he
saw a woman in the street he would shake the
stick at her and say: &#8220;Go back into the house.
An honest woman keeps indoors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably quite sensible. When she went indoors,
she went into a job. The &#8220;middle class&#8221;
daughter of to-day, if her mother is living and
housekeeping, goes indoors into a vacuum.</p>
<p>Out of that vacuum came the explosion which
created the first woman&#8217;s college.</p>
<p>There was plenty of sentiment in the explosion.
That was the splendid, blinding part of
it. That was the part of it which even to-day
dazzles us with the nobility of such women as
Emma Willard and Mary Lyon. They made
Troy Female Seminary in the twenties and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
Mount Holyoke in the thirties in the image of
the aspirations, as well as in the image of the
needs, of the women of the times.</p>
<p>But the needs were there, the need to <i>be</i> something,
the need to do something, self-respecting,
self-supporting. The existence of those needs
was clearly revealed in the fact that from the
early women&#8217;s colleges and from the early coeducational
universities there at once issued a
large supply of teachers.</p>
<p>This flow of teachers goes back to the very
fountain-head of the higher education of women
in this country. Emma Willard, even before
she founded Troy Female Seminary, back in the
days when she was running her school in Middlebury,
Conn., was training young women to
<i>teach</i>, and was acquiring her claim (which she
herself subsequently urged) to being regarded
as the organizer of the first normal school in the
United States.</p>
<p>From that time to this most college women
have taught school before getting married. <i>The
higher education of women has been, in economic
effect, a trade school for training women
for the trade of teacher.</i></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>But isn&#8217;t it the purpose of the colleges to
avoid training their pupils for specific occupations?
Isn&#8217;t it their purpose to give their pupils
discipline and culture, pure and broad, unaffected
by commercial intention? Isn&#8217;t that what
colleges are, and ought to be, for?</p>
<p>On the shore of this vast and violent controversy
we discreetly pause. We shall not enter
it. We cannot refrain, however, from extending
our finger at three reefs of solid fact which
unsubmergably jut out above the surface of the
raging waters.</p>
<p>First. The colleges instruct their pupils in
the subjects which those pupils subsequently
teach.</p>
<p>Second. The pupils specialize in the subjects
which they are going to teach.</p>
<p>Third. The colleges, besides providing the
future teachers with subjects, almost always
offer to provide them with instruction in the
principles of education, and frequently offer to
provide them with instruction in the very technique
of class-room work.</p>
<p>Our verdict, therefore, which we hope will
be satisfactory to counsel on both sides, is that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
the college is by no means a trade school, but
that if the woman who is going to earn her living
will choose the one trade of teaching, she
can almost always get a pretty fair trade training
by going to college.</p>
<p>Passing beyond even the suspicion of controversy,
we may observe, uncontradicted, that the
amount of trade training which a teacher is expected
to take is increasing year by year. In
teaching, as in other trades, the period and scope
of preliminary preparation continue to expand.</p>
<p>In the last calendar of Bryn Mawr College,
the Department of Education, in announcing its
courses, makes the following common-sense remarks:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the purpose of this department to offer
to students intending to become teachers an opportunity
to obtain a technical preparation for
their profession. Hitherto practical training
has been thought necessary for teachers of primary
schools only, but similar training is very
desirable for teachers in high schools and colleges
also. Indeed, it is already becoming
increasingly difficult for college graduates
without practical and theoretical pedagogical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
knowledge to secure good positions. In addition
to the lectures open to undergraduates, courses
will be organized for graduate students only,
conducted with special reference to preparation
for the headship and superintendence of
schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>There could hardly be a clearer recognition
of the <i>vocational</i> duty of a college. There is
meaning in that phrase &#8220;to secure good positions.&#8221;
Bryn Mawr is willing to train girls not
only to be cultivated but to secure good positions,
<i>as teachers</i>.</p>
<p>But the teaching trade is getting choked.
There is too much supply. Girls are going to
college in hordes. Graduating from college,
looking for work, there is usually just one kind
of work toward which they are mentally alert.
Their college experience has seldom roused
their minds toward any other kind of work.
They start to teach. They drug the market.
And so the teaching trade, the great occupation
of unmarried educated women, ceases to be able
to provide those women, as a class, with an adequate
field of employment.</p>
<p>It is a turning point in the economic history
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
of educated women. It is a turning point in the
history of women&#8217;s education.</p>
<p>At the 1909 annual convention of the Association
of Collegiate Alumn&#230;, in Cincinnati,
Miss Susan Kingsbury (acting for a committee
of which Mrs. Richards, of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and Miss Breckenridge,
of the University of Chicago, were members)
read a real essay on &#8220;The Economic Efficiency
of College Women.&#8221;</p>
<p>This essay was not written till detailed reports
on income and expenditure from 377 self-supporting
college women had been got together.</p>
<p>Out of these 377 there were 317 who were
teachers. All of them had gone all the way
through college. More than half of them had
followed up their regular college course with
from one to eight years of graduate study. The
capital invested in their education was, in the
average case, from $2,500 to $3,500. Often,
however, it amounted to $7,000 because of advanced
work and travel. After all this preparation,
the average income achieved may be
sufficiently disclosed in the one fact that, among
those graduates who had been at work for from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
six to eight years, more than seventy per cent.
were still earning less than $1,100.</p>
<p>After drawing a complete statistical picture
of the case, Miss Kingsbury concluded with certain
questions and recommendations, here condensed,
which show the new economic needs of
educated women knocking at the door of the
higher education.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should not the oversupply of teachers be
reduced by directing many of our graduates into
other pursuits than teaching? This will place
upon the college, just where the responsibility
is due, the obligation of discovering what those
opportunities are and what preparation should
be given.</p>
<p>&#8220;This organization should endeavor to
arouse in our colleges a sense of responsibility
for knowing the facts with regard to their
graduates, both social and economic, and should
also endeavor to influence our colleges through
appointment secretaries, to direct women, according
to fitness, into other lines than teaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should not courses be added to the college
curriculum to give women the fundamental

principles in other professions, or lines of industry
or commerce, than teaching?</p>
<p>&#8220;May not required courses be added to the
college curriculum to inculcate business power
and sense in all women?&#8221;</p>
<p>This philosophy seems to aim at making the
modern school as informative about the occupations
of modern women as the primitive colonial
home used to be about the occupations of the
women of early New England.</p>
<p>You see, we have always had vocational education.
The early New England girl was gradually
inducted into her life-tasks by her mother.
The modern girl will be gradually inducted into
her life-tasks by her teachers.</p>
<p>You can observe the development toward this
conclusion going on at any educational level you
please.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look for a moment at the industrial level.
Here&#8217;s a girl, in the north end of Boston, who is
going to have to go to work young. She knows
it. Her family knows it. Well, even for this
girl, whose schooling will be brief, there are
already three different periods of gradual induction
into industry.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>First, when she has completed the lowest
grades of her regular public school, she may go
for a while to the North Bennet Street Industrial
School. Here she will give just about half
her time to manual work such as machine- and
hand-sewing. She will also study arithmetic,
literature and composition, geography and history;
but (or, rather, <i>and</i>) her interest in these
subjects will be stimulated as powerfully as possible
by their practical applications, as well as
by their general relations, to the manual work
she is doing and to the working world she is so
soon to enter.</p>

</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>We are coming to admit</span> the fact now that
&#8220;pure&#8221; language and &#8220;pure&#8221; mathematics unapplied
to actual problems are, for the mass of
boys and girls, not only uninteresting but astonishingly
unproductive of mental results. One of
the first discoveries made by Mrs. Mary Schenck
Woolman in her management of the Manhattan
Trade School for Girls was that the public-school
pupils who came to her after several years
in the grades were &#8220;unable to utilize their public-school
academic work in practical trade affairs.&#8221;
Their progress, if it could be called so,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
had been toward reception, not toward action.
In the North Bennet Industrial School our Boston
girl will make progress toward action.</p>
<p>Next, from the North Bennet, she may go to
the Boston Trade School for Girls. This school
was given its first form under private management
by Miss Florence Marshall. It has now
been absorbed into the public-school system.
What was a private fad has become a public
function.</p>
<p>In the Trade School the pupil whom we are
following may decide to be a milliner. But she
will not yet confine her attention to millinery.
She will take courses in personal hygiene, business
forms, spelling, business English, industrial
conditions, textiles, color-design. She&#8217;s not yet
in the purely &#8220;technical&#8221; part of her education.
She&#8217;s still, to some extent, in the general vocational
part of it. But she is entering deeper and
deeper into technique. While in the Trade
School she will give much of her time for four
months to plain sewing, then for four months to
making summer hats and finally for four months
to making winter hats.</p>
<p>She has now completed two of the industrial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
educational periods we mentioned. She may go
on to a third. She may proceed to spend a year
in the millinery trade-shop of the Women&#8217;s
Educational and Industrial Union. Here she
will get into technique completely. The conditions
will be virtually those of a factory. She
will be trained to precision and to speed. Her
product will be sold. She will receive wages.
Yet she is still in school. She is still regarded
not as an employee to be discharged offhand for
incompetency but as a pupil to be instructed and
assisted on into competency.</p>
<p>When that girl goes to a real commercial millinery
shop she will be as thoroughly ready for
it as the New England girl was ready for a loom
when her mother let her at last run it by herself.</p>
<p>We have looked now at the industrial educational
level. And, happening to be in the
Women&#8217;s Educational and Industrial Union,
we can look at two other educational levels without
going out of the building.</p>
<p>On the commercial level we can remind ourselves
of the rapid spread of modern commercial
education by visiting the classroom of Mrs.
Prince&#8217;s school of department-store salesmanship.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
It is such a successful school now that the
Women&#8217;s Educational and Industrial Union
offers, in conjunction with Simmons College,
to teach people to teach salesmanship in other
similar schools which are being started elsewhere.</p>
<p>Leaving this commercial level, we can go to
the academic level by visiting the Appointment
Bureau. We may call it the academic level because
the Appointment Bureau exists chiefly for
the benefit of girls who have been to college.
Its purpose, however, is non-academic in the
extreme.</p>
<p>The Appointment Bureau is an employment
agency, and one of the most extraordinary employment
agencies ever organized. Its object is
not merely to introduce existing clients to existing
jobs (which is the proper normal function
of employment agencies), but to make forays
into the wild region of &#8220;occupations other than
teaching,&#8221; and there to find jobs, and then to
find girls to fit those jobs. In other words, it is
a kind of &#8220;Company of Adventurers Trading
into Hudson&#8217;s Bay&#8221; for the purpose of exploring,
surveying, developing, and settling the region
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
of &#8220;occupations other than teaching&#8221; on
behalf of college women.</p>
<p>It is managed by Miss Laura Drake Gill,
president of the National Association of Collegiate
Alumn&#230; and former dean of Barnard College.
She is assisted by an advisory council
of representatives of near-by colleges&mdash;Radcliffe,
Wellesley, Simmons, Mount Holyoke,
Smith, and Brown.</p>
<p>In harmony with this work the Women&#8217;s Educational
and Industrial Union has just issued a
handbook of three hundred pages, entitled
&#8220;Vocations for the Trained Woman.&#8221; It is an
immense map of the occupational world for
educated women, in which every bay and headland,
every lake and hill, is drawn to scale,
from poultry farming to department-store buying,
from lunch-room management to organized
child-saving.</p>
<p>We here see the educational system, at its college
academic level, moving not simply toward
preparing girls for money-earning work but
also toward actually putting them into that
work and, in order to put them into it, finding it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>This last innovation, this advising of graduates
with regard to the occupational world and
this guiding of them into the occupations for
which they are best fitted, will bring education
closer to the ultimate needs of those who are
being educated than any other innovation of
recent years. It will establish the final permanent
contact between two isolations,&mdash;the isolation
of aimless learning and the isolation of
ignorant doing. It is still, however, a project,
a prospect. The other two innovations which
we have mentioned press closer to immediacy.
Immediate, certainly, is the demand of &#8220;middle
class&#8221; women for larger occupational opportunities.
And almost immediate is the success
of the demand that the school system shall fit
them to the use of those opportunities.</p>
<p>In a small Illinois city there is a woman&#8217;s college,
founded as a preparatory school in the
forties and soon advanced to be a seminary,
which, with Anna P. Sill for its first head, Jane
Addams for its best-known graduate, and Julia
Gulliver for its present president, has come to
be a college of standing and of leading. Only
Troy Female Seminary and Mount Holyoke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Seminary preceded it, in date of foundation,
among the important women&#8217;s institutions.</p>
<p>Rockford College is ranked to-day, by the
reports of the United States Commissioner of
Education, in rank one&mdash;among the sixteen best
women&#8217;s colleges in the United States. It hasn&#8217;t
risen to that rank by any quick, money-spurred
spurt. It brings with it out of its far past all
the traditions of that early struggle for the
higher education which, by friction, kindled
among women so flaming an enthusiasm for pure
knowledge. It remains &#8220;collegiate&#8221; in the old
sense, quiet, cloistral, inhabiting old-fashioned
brick buildings in an old-fashioned large yard,
looking still like the Illinois of war times more
than like the Illinois of the twentieth century,
retaining all the home ideals of those times&mdash;a
large interest in feminine accomplishments, a
strict regard for manners, a belief in the value
of charm.</p>
<p>But here, in this quiet, non-metropolitan college,
so really &#8220;academic,&#8221; so really&mdash;in the
oldest-fashioned ways&mdash;&#8220;cultural,&#8221; here is a
two-year course in Secretarial Studies.</p>

ROCKFORD COLLEGE, IN ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS. IN ITS OLD-FASHIONED BUILDINGS, WHICH PRESERVE THE SPIRIT OF THE ACADEMIC LIFE OF THE OLD DAYS, THERE IS NOW A VERY MODERN DEPARTMENT OF SECRETARIAL STUDIES.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>It is the first time</span> (within our knowledge)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
that such a thing has happened in any of the old
first-rank women&#8217;s colleges.</p>
<p>The course in Secretarial Studies at Rockford
gives the pupil English, accounts, commerce,
commercial law, and economic history in her
first year, and political science, English, and
economics in her second year. Shorthand and
typewriting are required in both years, and a
few hours a week are reserved in each year for
elective courses to be chosen by the pupil among
offerings in French, German, Spanish, and history.</p>
<p>There is here a double concession: first, to the
increased need of &#8220;middle class&#8221; women for
&#8220;occupations other than teaching&#8221;; second, to
the increased recognition of those other occupations
as being worthy of &#8220;cultural&#8221; training.</p>
<p>This turn in education has been made on an
economic pivot. The commercial and industrial
occupations of the world are coming to demand
scholastic preparation. And the women
who have had scholastic preparation, even the
most complete and long-continued scholastic
preparation, are coming to demand admission
into the commercial and industrial occupations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
of the world. The era of the purely scholastic
occupation <i>and no other</i> for the scholastically
trained woman has come to an end.</p>
<p>We have observed the contraction of the home
as a field of adequate employment for daughters.
We have observed the postponement of
marriage in its effect on the occupational opportunities
of those daughters. Deprived of adequate
employment at home, we have seen them
seek it elsewhere. Marriage and housekeeping
and child-rearing, as an occupation, we have
seen deferred to a later and later period in life.
Let us now assume that every woman who has
a husband is removed from money-earning
work. It is an assumption very contrary to fact.
But let us make it. And then let us look at this
compact picture of the extent to which being
married is an occupation for American women:</p>
<p>In the United States, in the year 1900, among
women twenty years of age and over, the
married women numbered 13,400,000. The
unmarried women and the widows together
numbered 6,900,000. For every two women
married there was one woman either single or
widowed.</p>

THESE CHILDREN IN THE FRANCIS PARKER SCHOOL IN CHICAGO ARE GETTING AN EARLY START IN THEIR TRAINING FOR THEIR FUTURE WORK IN THEIR HOMES.<br />

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>What futility, as well as indignity, there is in
the idea that the query of support for women
gets its full answer in a husband!</p>
<p>Surely we may now say: If education does
not (1) give women a comprehension of the
organization of the money-earning world, and
(2) train them to one of the techniques which
lead to self-support in that world, it is not education.</p>
<p>Just at this point, though, we encounter a
curious conflict in women&#8217;s education. Just as
we see their urgent need of a money-earning
technique, we simultaneously hear, coming
from a corner of the battlefield and swelling till
it fills the air with a nation-wide battle cry, the
sentiment: &#8220;The Home is also a technique. All
women must be trained to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Rockford College, illustrating this conflict,
there exists, besides the course in Secretarial
Studies, an equivalent course in Home
Economics.</p>
<p>In an illustration in this chapter we show the
tiny children of the Francis Parker School in
Chicago taking their first lesson in the technique
of the home. In another picture we show the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
post-graduate laboratory in the technique of the
home at the University of Illinois. And the
space between the kindergarten and the degree
of Doctor of Philosophy threatens to get filled
up almost everywhere with courses in cooking,
sewing, chemistry of diet, composition of textiles,
art of marketing, and other phases of home
management.</p>
<p>The money-earning world, a technique! The
home, a technique! The boy learns only one.
Must the girl learn two, be twice a specialist?</p>

</div>
<p>The First International Congress on Domestic
Science and Arts was held in 1908
at Fribourg in Switzerland. It was no improvised,
amateur-uplift, private-theatricals affair.</p>
<p>The head of the organizing committee was
M. Python, president of Fribourg&#8217;s State Council.
Seventy-two papers on technical topics
were printed and circulated beforehand. The
participating members numbered seven hundred.
The discussions developed the characteristic
points of three rival varieties of household-arts
instruction&mdash;the German, the Swiss,
and the Belgian. Visits were made to the normal
schools of Fribourg, Berne, and Zurich, in
each of which there is an elaborate system for
the training of household-arts teachers. In the
end, in order that facts and ideas about the education
of girls for their duties as housekeepers
might be more rapidly circulated, it was voted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
to establish, at some place in Switzerland, a
Permanent International Information Committee.</p>
<p>Thus, in an age in which the productive tasks
of the home have almost all been surrendered to
the factory; in an age in which even cooking
and sewing, last puny provinces of a once ample
empire, are forever slaking concessions of territory
to those barbarian invaders,&mdash;the manufacturers
of ready-to-eat foods and ready-to-wear
clothes; in an age in which home industry lies
fainting and gasping, while Mrs. Charlotte Perkins
Gilman begs the spectators to say &#8220;thumbs
down&#8221; and let her put it out of its agony altogether&mdash;in
such an age there comes, at Fribourg,
in this First International Congress on Domestic
Science and Arts, the most serious, the most
notable, recognition ever given in any age to the
home&#8217;s economic value.</p>
<p>A real paradox? Well, at any rate, it gives
wings to the fluttering thought that theories of
industrial evolution, one&#8217;s own as well as Mrs.
Gilman&#8217;s, are a bit like automobiles&mdash;not always
all that they are cranked up to be.</p>
<p>Certainly the revival of the home seems to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
attract larger crowds to the mourners&#8217; bench
every year.</p>
<p>At the University of Missouri the first crop
of graduates in home economics was gathered
in the spring of 1910. They were seven. Of
the 120 units of work required for graduation
they had earned at least 38 in such subjects as
&#8220;Textiles and Clothing,&#8221; &#8220;Food Chemistry,&#8221;
&#8220;General Foods,&#8221; &#8220;Advanced Foods,&#8221; &#8220;Home
Sanitation,&#8221; &#8220;House Furnishing and Decoration,&#8221;
and &#8220;Home Administration.&#8221; Most of
them, besides taking a degree in Home Economics,
took likewise a degree in Education. We
may therefore assume that schools as well as
homes will listen to their new message.</p>
<p>Their preceptress, Miss Edna D. Day, who
subsequently left Missouri to organize a department
of home economics in the University of
Kansas, is a novel type of New Woman in that
she has earned the degree of Doctor of Philosophy
in &#8220;Woman&#8217;s Sphere.&#8221; She took graduate
work in the department of home administration
in the University of Chicago and achieved
her doctorate with an investigation into &#8220;The
Effect of Cooking on the Digestibility of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
Starch.&#8221; What she found out was subsequently
printed as a bulletin by the United States Department
of Agriculture.</p>
<p>In the midst of the festivities at the wake held
over the home, it perplexes the mourners to
learn that some of those domestic science bulletins
of the United States Department of Agriculture
excite a demand for a million copies.</p>
<p>It is a wake like Mike McCarthy&#8217;s.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Mike was lookin&#8217; iligant</p>
<p>As he rested there in state.</p>
</div></div>
<p>But</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>When the fun was at its height</p>
<p>McCarthy sat up straight.</p>
</div></div>
<p>This ballad (one of the most temperately
worded of literary successes) goes on to say that
&#8220;the effect was great.&#8221; So it has been in the
parallel case here considered&mdash;great enough to
be felt all the way around the world.</p>
<p>It is being felt in the Island Empire of the
East. Miss Ume Tsuda&#8217;s Institute at Tokyo
(which stands so high that its graduates are allowed
to teach in secondary schools without further
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
government examination) has installed
courses in English domestic science as well as
in the domestic science of Japan.</p>
<p>It is being felt in the Island Empire of the
West. King&#8217;s College, of the University of
London, has organized a three-year course leading
to the degree of Mistress of Home Science,
and has also established a &#8220;Post-Graduates&#8217;
Course in Home Science,&#8221; in which out of fourteen
students (in the first year of its existence)
four were graduates of the courses of academic
study of Oxford or Cambridge.</p>
<p>It is being felt in the United States at every
educational level.</p>
<p>We expect domestic science and art now in
the schools of agriculture and we regard it
as natural that the legislature of Montana
should appropriate $50,000 to the Montana
State Agricultural College for a women&#8217;s dormitory.</p>
<p>We expect domestic science and art in the elementary
schools and we are not astonished to
find that in Boston, in every grade above the
third, for every girl, there is sewing, or cooking,
or both, for 120 minutes every week.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>We begin to expect domestic science and art
in the high schools. In Illinois there are 71
high schools in which instruction is offered in
one or more of the three great divisions of the
Study of Daily Life&mdash;Food, Clothing, the
Home. In such of these high schools as are
within the limits of the city of Chicago there
is a four-year Household-Arts course so contrived
that the girls who enroll themselves in it,
while not neglecting literature, art, and the pure
sciences like physics, will spend at least eight
hours every week on &#8220;Domestic Science&#8221; or on
&#8220;Textiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are impelled now to admit that the work
done in domestic science and art by the high
schools should be recognized by the colleges and
universities. The University of California requires
its freshmen to come to it with 45 &#8220;units&#8221;
of standardized high-school work, of various
sorts, accomplished. We learn, but we are not
startled when we learn, that the University of
California will henceforth allow the entering
freshman to offer nine of her 45 &#8220;units&#8221; in
sewing, dressmaking, millinery, decorating,
furnishing (all accompanied with free-hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
drawing); and in cooking, hygiene, dietetics,
laundering, nursing (all accompanied with
chemistry).</p>
<p>Even in the colleges and universities themselves,
especially if they are of recent foundation,
we accept, if we do not expect, a domestic-science-and-art
department of utilitarian value
and of academic worth. At Chicago University
it is called the Department of Household Administration;
sixty women undergraduates are
specializing in it. At the University of Illinois
it is called the Department of Household
Science; one-third of all the women in the university
are taking courses in it; one-fifth of them
are &#8220;majoring&#8221; in it; number four of volume
two of the university bulletins is by Miss
Sprague on &#8220;A Precise Method of Roasting
Beef&#8221;; in the research laboratory Miss Goldthwaite,
<i>Doctor</i> Goldthwaite, is making chemical
experiments with pectin, sugar, fruit-juice,
tartaric acid, to the point of determining that
the mixture should be withdrawn from heat at
a temperature of 103 degrees Centigrade and at
a specific gravity of 1.28 in order that it shall
invariably &#8220;jell&#8221;; in the graduate school the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
women who attend the household-arts seminar
are being directed toward original inquiries
into &#8220;Co-operative Housekeeping,&#8221; &#8220;Dietetic
Cults,&#8221; &#8220;Hygiene of Clothing,&#8221; &#8220;Pure Food
Laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing how far the newer universities go, we
return to rest our eyes, without their rolling in
the frenzy which would attack Alexander Hamilton
if he were with us, on Hamilton&#8217;s alma
mater, Columbia University, venerable but adventurous,
giving courses in &#8220;Housewifery,&#8221;
in &#8220;Shirtwaists,&#8221; and in &#8220;Domestic Laundering.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not till we come to the really-truly, more
than masculinely, academic and cultural eastern
women&#8217;s colleges such as Vassar, Wellesley,
Smith, and Bryn Mawr that we experience a
genuine journalistic shock on hearing a domestic-science-and-art
piece of news. Those colleges
will be the last to succumb. But the day
of their fall approaches. The alumn&#230; association
of Wellesley voted, in 1910, to petition the
trustees to establish home-economics courses;
and, in the same year, the president of Wellesley
put into her commencement address the words:
&#8220;I hope the time may soon come when we can
have a department of domestic science which
shall give a sound basis for the problems of the
household.&#8221;</p>
<p>The resuscitated Home has become one of the
livest of pedagogical personages. It has added
a great and growing field to the estate of Education.
To supply that field with teachers of
high qualifications we find highly extended
training courses in such institutions as Drexel
in Philadelphia, Pratt in Brooklyn, Simmons in
Boston and Teachers College in New York. In
fact, the conclusion of the epoch of pioneer domestic-science-and-art
agitation might perhaps
be said to have been announced to the country
when Teachers College, in 1909, erected a new
building at a cost of $500,000 and dedicated it,
in its entirety, to Household Arts.</p>
<p>What does it all mean?</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellow citizens,&#8221; said the colored orator,
reported by Dr. Paul Monroe of Columbia,
&#8220;what am education? Education am the palladium
of our liberties and the grand pandemonium
of civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it does mean something, this Home Economics
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
disturbance. <i>And something very different
from what it seems to.</i></p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>Mr. Edward T. Devine, of the New York
Charity Organization Society, has distinguished
himself in the field of economic thought as well
as in the field of active social reform. Among
his works is a minute but momentous treatise on
&#8220;The Economic Function of Women.&#8221; It is
really a plea for the proposition that to-day the
art of consuming wealth is just as important a
study as the art of producing it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If acquisition,&#8221; says Mr. Devine, &#8220;has been
the idea which in the past history of economics
has been unduly emphasized, expenditure is the
idea which the future history of the science will
place beside it.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have used our brains while getting hold
of money. We are going to use our brains while
getting rid of it. We have studied banking,
engineering, shop practice, cost systems, salesmanship.
We are going to study food values,
the hygiene of clothing, the sanitary construction
and operation of living quarters, the mental
reaction of amusements, the distribution of income,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the art of making choices, according to
our means, from among the millions of things,
harmful and helpful, ugly and beautiful, offered
to us by the producing world.</p>
<p>Mr. Devine ventures to hope that &#8220;we may
look for a radical improvement in general economic
conditions from a wiser use of the wealth
which we have chosen to produce.&#8221;</p>
<p>This enlarged view of the economic importance
of consumption brings with it a correspondingly
enlarged view of the economic importance
of the Home. &#8220;If the factory,&#8221; says
Mr. Devine, &#8220;has been the center of the economics
which has had to do with Production,
the home will displace the factory as the center
of interest in a system which gives due prominence
to Enjoyment and Use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There will result,&#8221; continues Mr. Devine,
&#8220;an increased respect on the part of economists
for the industrial function which woman performs,&#8221;
for &#8220;there is no economic function
higher than that of determining how wealth
shall be used,&#8221; so that &#8220;even if man remain the
chief producer of wealth and woman remain the
chief factor in determining how wealth shall be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
used, the economic position of woman will not
be considered by those who judge with discrimination
to be inferior to that of man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Devine then lays out for the economist
a task in the discharge of which the innocent
bystander will sincerely wish him a pleasant
trip and a safe return.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the present duty of the economist,&#8221;
says Mr. Devine, &#8220;to accompany the wealth
expender to the very threshold of the home, that
he may point out, with untiring vigilance, its
emptiness, caused not so much by lack of income
as by lack of knowledge of how to spend
wisely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Devine&#8217;s proposition therefore would
seem finally to sanction some such conclusion as
this:</p>
<p>Physical science and social science (and common
sense) are making such important contributions
to the subject of the rearing of children
and to the subject of the maintenance of wholesome
and beautiful living conditions and to the
subject of the use of leisure that, while the home
woman has lost almost all of the productive industries
which she once controlled, she has simultaneously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
gained a whole new field of labor.
Consumption has ceased to be merely <i>passive</i>
and has become <i>active</i>. It has ceased to be mere
<i>Absorption</i> and has become <i>Choice</i>. And the
active choosing of the products of the world
(both spiritual and material) in connection with
her children, her house, and her spare time has
developed for the home woman into a task so
broad, into an art so difficult, as to require
serious study.</p>
<p>We have quoted at length from Mr. Devine&#8217;s
discourse because it is recognized as the classic
statement of the case and because it has had the
warm personal commendation of such women
as the late Mrs. Ellen H. Richards, of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose
skill as scientist and vision as philosopher made
her the most authoritative personality in the
American Home Economics Association. (That
association, by the way, has some fifteen hundred
due-paying members.)</p>
<p>The scales fall from our eyes now and we see
at least one thing which we had not seen before.
We had supposed that sewing and cooking were
the vitals of the home economics movement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
Not at all! The home woman might cease altogether
to sew and to cook (just as she has ceased
altogether to spin, weave, brew, etc.) without
depriving the home economics movement of any
considerable part of its driving power. Sewing
and cooking are productive processes. They
add economic value to certain commodities;
namely, cloth and food. But it is not production,
it is consumption, which the home economics
movement is at heart devoted to.</p>
<p>This is plainly set forth by some of its most
zealous workers. Thus Edna D. Day, at the
Lake Placid Conference on home economics
in 1908, was more or less sorry that &#8220;domestic
science has come to be so largely sewing and
cooking in our schools&#8221;; was quite willing to
look at the white of the eye of the fact that
&#8220;more and more we are buying ready-made
clothes and ready-cooked foods&#8221;; and marked
out the policy of her &#8220;Survey Course in Home
Economics&#8221; at the University of Missouri in
the statement that &#8220;sewing and cooking are decreasingly
home problems, while the problems
of wise buying, of adjusting standards of living
to income, and of developing right feelings in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
regard to family responsibilities are increasingly
difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>To choose and use the world&#8217;s resources intelligently
on behalf of family and community&mdash;in
this Mr. Devine saw a new field of action, in this
Mrs. Richards saw a new field of education.</p>
<p>Women will train themselves for their duties
as consumers or else continue to lie under
the sentence of condemnation pronounced upon
them by Florence Nightingale. &#8220;Three-fourths
of the mischief in women&#8217;s lives,&#8221; said
she, &#8220;arises from their excepting themselves
from the rule of training considered necessary
for men.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what, in this case, is the training proposed?</p>
<p>The answer to that question will cause some
more scales to fall from our eyes. Just as we
have seen that home economics does not consist
essentially of sewing and cooking, we shall see
that consumption is not at all a specialized technique
in the sense in which electrical engineering,
department-store buying, railroading, cotton
manufacturing, medicine, and the other
occupations of the outside world are specialized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
techniques. Home economics will not narrow
women&#8217;s education but in the end will enlarge
it. For consumption, instead of being a specialty,
is a generality so broad as almost to
glitter.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>At Menomonie, Wis., Mr. L. D. Harvey,
lately president of the National Education Association,
has established a Homemakers&#8217; School.
It does not turn out teachers. Its course of
instruction is solely for the prospective housewife.</p>
<p>If we look at the number of things the prospective
housewife is to be we shall soon perceive
that she cannot be any one of them in any
specialized technical way and that what she is
getting is not so much a training for a trade as
a training for life at large.</p>
<p>The first grand division of study is The
House.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>We here observe that</span> the housewife is going
to be something of a sanitary engineer, since
she studies chemistry, physics, and bacteriology
in their &#8220;application to such subjects as the
heating, lighting, ventilation, and plumbing of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
a house.&#8221; It is thought that knowledge of this
sort &#8220;will go a long way toward improving the
health conditions of the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>We also observe that the housewife is going to
be something of an interior decorator, since she
studies &#8220;design, color, house planning and furnishing.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also acquires some skill as purchasing
agent, bookkeeper, and employer of labor when
she takes the course on household management
and studies &#8220;the proper apportioning of income
among the different lines of home expenditures,
the systematizing and keeping of household accounts,
and the question of domestic service.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second grand division is Food Study
and Preparation.</p>
<p>Here the housewife becomes, to some extent,
a dietitian, studying &#8220;the chemical processes in
the preparation and digestion of foods,&#8221; and
considering the question &#8220;how she shall secure
for the family the foods best suited to the various
activities of each individual.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here, likewise, she makes a start toward being
a pure-food expert, through a study of &#8220;physical
and chemical changes induced in food products
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
by the growth of molds, yeasts, and bacteria,&#8221;
and a start toward being a health officer,
through a study of &#8220;bacteria in their relation to
disease, sources of infection, personal and household
disinfection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor does she omit to acquire some of the technique
of the physical director through a course
in physiology bearing on &#8220;digestion, storage of
energy, rest, sleep, exercise, and regularity of
habits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, in her work in cookery, she pays
some attention to special cookery for invalids.</p>
<p>The third grand division, that of Clothing
and Household Fabrics, produces a dressmaker,
a milliner, and an embroiderer, as well as a person
trained to see to it that &#8220;the expenditure
for clothing shall be correct in proportion to
the expenditure for other purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fourth grand division, the Care of Children,
is of course limitless. The rearing of the
human young is, as we all know and as Mr.
Eliot of Harvard has insisted, the most intellectual
occupation in the world. Here the homemaker
applies all the knowledge she has gained
from her study of the hygiene of foods and of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
the hygiene of clothes, and also makes some
progress toward becoming a trained nurse and a
kindergartner by means of researches into &#8220;infant
diseases and emergencies,&#8221; &#8220;the stages of
the mental development of the child,&#8221; &#8220;the
child&#8217;s imagination with regard to truth-telling
and deceit,&#8221; &#8220;the history of children&#8217;s books,&#8221;
and &#8220;the art of story-telling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Passing over the fifth grand division, Home
Nursing and Emergencies (in which the pupil
learns simply &#8220;the use of household remedies,&#8221;
&#8220;the care of the sick room,&#8221; etc.), we come to
the wide expanse of the sixth grand division,
Home and Social Economics.</p>
<p>The work in this division begins with a study
of the primitive evolution of the home and
comes on down to the present time, when &#8220;the
passing of many of the former lines of woman&#8217;s
work into the factory has brought to many
women leisure time which should be spent in
social service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note that last fact carefully. <i>Home economics
is no attempt to drive women back into home
seclusion. On the contrary, it is an attempt to
bring the home and its occupants into the scientific
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
and sociological developments of the outside
world.</i></p>
<p>For this reason, in traversing the division of
home and social economics, the pupil encounters
&#8220;an effort to determine problems in civic
life which seem to be a part of the duties of
women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seventhly and lastly, there is a division dedicated
to Literature, in which &#8220;a systematic
course in reading is carried on through the two
years.&#8221; Indispensable! No degree of proficiency
at inserting calories in correct numbers
into Little Sally&#8217;s stomach could atone for lack
of skill in leading Little Sally herself through
the &#8220;Child&#8217;s Garden of Verses&#8221; with trowel
in hand to dig up the gayest plants and reset
them in the memory.</p>
<p>So we come back to our old statement and
vary it in phrase but not in effect by saying
that home-economics courses, totaled, do not
give a <i>technique</i> so much as an <i>outlook</i>.</p>
<p>The homemaker may happen to be a specialist
in some one direction, but it is clear that
she cannot simultaneously know as much about
food values as the real dietitian, as much about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
the physical care of her child as the real trained
nurse, as much about the wholesomeness of her
living arrangements as the real sanitarian, as
much about music as the Thomas Orchestra, as
much about social service as Mr. Devine, and
as much about poems as Mr. Stevenson. Her
peculiar equipment, if she is a good homemaker,
is a round of experience and a bent of
mind which make it possible for her to coperate
intelligently with the dietitian, the trained
nurse, the sanitarian, the Thomas Orchestra,
Mr. Devine, Mr. Stevenson, and the various
other representatives of the various other specialized
techniques of the outside world.</p>
<p>It follows that her school discipline cannot
be too comprehensive. No other occupation demands
such breadth of sense and sensibility.
One could make a perfectly good cotton manufacturer
on the basis of a very narrow training.
One cannot make a good consumer without a
really <i>liberal education</i>.</p>
<p>For this reason it becomes necessary to resist
certain narrownesses in certain phases of home
economics.</p>
<p>One of these narrownesses is the assumption
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
that because a thing happens to be close to us it
is therefore important. We have heard lecturers
insist that because a house contains drain
pipes a woman should learn <i>all</i> about drain
pipes. But why? In most communities drain
pipes are installed and repaired and in every
way controlled by gentlemen who are drainpipe
specialists. The woman who lives in the
house has no more need of a professional knowledge
of the structural mysteries of drain pipes
than a reporter has of a professional knowledge
of the structural mysteries of his typewriting
machine. The reporter is supplemented at that
point by the office mechanic and, so far as his
efficiency as a reporter is concerned, a technical
inquiry into his faithful keyboard&#8217;s internal arrangements
would be in most cases an amiable
waste of time.</p>
<p>Another possible narrowness is the attempt to
manufacture &#8220;cultural backgrounds&#8221; for various
important but quite safe-and-sane household
tasks.</p>
<p>For instance, in the books and in the courses
of instruction (of college grade) on &#8220;the
house&#8221; we have sometimes observed elaborate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
accounts of the evolution of the human home,
beginning with the huts of the primitive Simians.
And in pursuing the very essential subject
of &#8220;clothes and fabrics&#8221; we have not infrequently
found ourselves in the midst of spacious
preliminary dissertations on the structure of the
loom, beginning with that which was used by
the Anthropenguins.</p>
<p>Now we would not for the world speak disparagingly
of looms or huts. We have ourselves
examined some of them in the Hull House Museum
in Chicago and in the woods of Canada,
and have found them instructive. We suggest
only that college life is short, that the college
curriculum is crowded, and that (except possibly
for those students who are especially interested
in anthropology or in industrial evolution)
it would surely be a misfortune to learn
of the Simian hut and to miss Rossetti&#8217;s &#8220;House
of Life,&#8221; or to get the impression that as a &#8220;cultural
background&#8221; for shirtwaists the Anthropenguinian
loom can really compete with Carlyle&#8217;s
&#8220;Sartor Resartus.&#8221;</p>
<p>If this occasional tendency toward exaggerating
the importance of drain pipes, window
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
curtains, and door mats were to grow strong,
and if girls, as a class, should be required to
spend any large proportion of their time on the
specialized history and sociology of feminine
implements and tasks while the boys were still
in the current of the affairs of the race, we
should indeed want President Thomas of Bryn
Mawr to repeat on a thousand lecture platforms
her indignant assertion of the fact that &#8220;nothing
more disastrous for women, or for men, can
be conceived of than specialized education of
women as a sex.&#8221;</p>
<p>These parenthetical observations, however,
amount simply to the expression of our personal
opinion that home economics, like every new
idea, carries with it large quantities of dross
which will have to be refined out in the smelter
of trial. The real metal in it is its attempt to
establish the principle that intelligent consumption
is an important and difficult task. For that
reason it will not only desire but demand the
utmost equality of educational opportunity.
And women, like men, will continue to get
their &#8220;cultural backgrounds&#8221; in the great
achievements of the whole race, where they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
can hold converse with Lincoln and Darwin
and the makers of the Cologne Cathedral
and George Meredith and Pasteur and Karl
Marx and Whistler and Joan of Arc and St.
John.</p>
<p>The woman voiced a great truth who said
that the soul which can irradiate the numberless
pettinesses of home management (and it is
folly to deny that there <i>are</i> numberless pettinesses
in it) is the soul &#8220;nourished elsewhere.&#8221;
Think that over. It tells the story. Whether
the &#8220;elsewhere&#8221; is the deep recesses of her
own religious nature or the wide stretches of
the great arts and sciences, it is always an &#8220;elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let that be granted, as it must be granted.
Let us say that there shall be no abridgment of
the offerings of so-called academic education.
What does a course of study like that of Mr.
Harvey&#8217;s Homemakers&#8217; School attempt to add
to academic education?</p>
<p>Principally three things.</p>
<p>First: Certain manual arts.</p>
<p>Second: Certain domestic applications of the
physical and sociological sciences.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>Third: Money sense in expenditure (in the
course on household management).</p>
<p>Let us review these things in reverse order.</p>
<p>The last of the three is showing itself in many
places. At the University of Illinois, for instance,
Professor Kinley, recently delegate from
the United States to the Pan-American Congress,
has given courses in home administration
for women which he has regarded as of equal
importance with his courses in business administration
for men.</p>
<p>At the University of Chicago, in the department
of household administration, course 44
is on &#8220;the administration of the house&#8221; and
includes &#8220;the proper apportionment of income.&#8221;</p>
<p>The business man says: &#8220;My sales cost, or
my manufacturing cost, or my office force cost,
is such and such a per cent. of my total cost.
When it goes above that, I want to know why;
and I find out; and, if there isn&#8217;t a mighty good
reason for its going up, I make it go down
again to where it was.&#8221; Shall we come to the
day when in spending the money which has
been earned in business we shall say: &#8220;Such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
and such a per cent. to food; and such and such
a per cent. to clothes; and such and such a per
cent. to shelter; and such and such a per cent. to
health and recreation; and such and such a per
cent. to good works; and such and such other
per cents. to such and such other purposes&#8221;?
Shall we come to the day when we shall consume
wealth with as much forethought and
with as much balance of judgment between conflicting
claims as we now exhibit in acquiring
wealth?</p>
<p>They are trying to develop this &#8220;costs system
for home expenditures&#8221; in many of the
schools and departments of home economics to-day.
They believe that most people, because of
not looking ahead and because of not making
definite plans based on previous experience,
come to the contemplation of their bills on the
first of each month with every reason to confess
that they have bought those things which they
ought not to have bought and have left unbought
those things which they ought to have
bought.</p>
<p>But it is not only a matter of reaching a systematic
instead of a helter-skelter enjoyment of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
the offerings of the world. It is also a matter
of reaching, by study of money values, a mental
habit of economy. And it comes at a time when
that habit is needed.</p>
<p>We are just beginning to realize in the
United States that we cannot spend all our
annual earnings on living expenses and still
have a surplus for fresh capital for new industrial
enterprises. We are on the point of perceiving
that we are cramping and stunting the
future industrial expansion of the country by
our personal extravagance. We shall soon
really believe Mr. James J. Hill when he says
that &#8220;every dollar unprofitably spent is a crime
against posterity.&#8221;</p>
<p>When international industrial competition
reaches its climax, that nation will have an advantage
whose people feel most keenly that the
wise expenditure of income is a patriotic as
well as a personal duty.</p>
<p>But is this a matter for women alone? Do
not men also consume? Are there no vats in
Milwaukee, no stills in Kentucky, no factories
wrapping paper rings around bunches of dead
leaves at Tampa? Are there no men&#8217;s tailors,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
gents&#8217; furnishing shops, luncheons, clubs, banquets,
athletics, celebrations? And as for home
expenditures themselves, is the man simply to
bring the plunder to the door, get patted on the
head, and trot off in search of more plunder?
We must doubt if economy will be reached
by such a route. We find ourselves agreeing
rather with the home economics lecturer
who said: &#8220;There never yet was a family
income really wisely expended without coperation
in all matters between husband and wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Massachusetts legislature has passed a
law looking toward the teaching of thrift in
the public schools. Boys and girls need it
equally. And we venture to surmise that in so
far as the new art and science of consumption
is concerned with wise spending, the bulk of its
teachings ultimately will be enjoyed by both
sexes. It will not be, to any great extent, a
specialized education for women.</p>
<p>So much for the &#8220;money sense in expenditure&#8221;
which a full home economics course adds
to &#8220;academic&#8221; education. The more we admit
its value, the more convinced we must be that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
it ought to include every kind of expenditure
and both kinds of human being.</p>
<p>A precisely similar conviction arises with
regard to those &#8220;domestic applications of the
physical and sociological sciences&#8221; which a
full home economics course adds to an &#8220;academic&#8221;
education.</p>
<p>Those &#8220;domestic&#8221; applications are most of
them broadly &#8220;human&#8221; applications. They
bear on daily living, exercise, fresh air, personal
cleanliness, diet, sleep, the avoidance of
contagion, methods of fighting off disease, general
physical efficiency. They largely amount
to what Mrs. Ellen H. Richards used to call
Right Living. She wanted four R&#8217;s instead
of three: Reading, Riting, Rithmetic, Right
Living.</p>
<p>Now is Right Living to be only for girls?</p>
<p>Mr. Eliot of Harvard does not think so. In
a recent &#8220;Survey of the Needs of Education,&#8221;
he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Public instruction in preventive medicine
must be provided for all children and the hygienic
method of living must be taught in all
schools.... To make this new knowledge and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
skill a universal subject of instruction in our
schools, colleges, and universities is by no means
impossible&mdash;indeed, it would not even be difficult,
for it is a subject full of natural history as
well as social interest.... American schools
of every sort ought to provide systematic instruction
on public and private hygiene, diet,
sex hygiene, and the prevention of disease and
premature death, not only because these subjects
profoundly affect human affections and public
happiness, but because they are of high economic
importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may very well be that what Mr. Eliot had
in mind will not only come to pass but will
even exceed his expectations. It may very well
be that the educational policy of the future was
correctly search-lighted by Miss Henrietta I.
Goodrich (who used to direct the Boston School
of Housekeeping before it was merged into
Simmons College) when she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to have courage to break the present
courses in household arts and domestic
science into their component parts and begin
again on the much broader basis of a study of
living conditions. Our plea would be this: that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
instruction in the facts of daily living be incorporated
in the state&#8217;s educational system from
the primary grades through the graduate departments
of the universities, with a rank equal
to that of any subject that is taught, <i>as required
work for both boys and girls</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>We revert now finally to the &#8220;manual arts&#8221;
which a full course in home economics adds to
an &#8220;academic&#8221; education. In this matter, just
as in the matter of money sense in expenditure
and in the matter of right living, we observe
that the ultimate issue of the movement is not so
much a specialized education for women as a
practical efficiency in the common things of life
for men and women both.</p>
<p>A reasonable proficiency in manual arts will
some day be the heritage of all educated people.
Mr. Eliot, in his &#8220;Survey of the Needs of
Education,&#8221; speaks appreciatingly of his father&#8217;s
having caused him to learn carpentry
and wood-turning. He goes on to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;This I hold to be the great need of education
in the United States&mdash;the devoting of a
much larger proportion of the total school time
to the training of the eye, ear, and hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>It follows, then, that cooking and sewing for
girls in the elementary schools must be made
just as rigorous a discipline for eye and hand
as wood-working is for boys. It even follows
that boys and girls will often get their manual
training together.</p>
<p>It will not be a case of &#8220;household drudgery&#8221;
for the girls while the boys are studying
civics.</p>
<p>Somewhere in this chapter the reader will
find a picture of the &#8220;living room&#8221; of the
&#8220;model&#8221; house of the Washington-Allston Elementary
School in Boston. The boys and girls
of graduating grade in that school give four
hours a week to matters connected with the welfare
of that house. They have furnished it
throughout with their own handiwork, the girls
making pillow-cases, wall-coverings, window-curtains,
etc., and the boys making chairs, tables,
cupboards, etc. Succeeding classes will furnish
it again. <i>The reason why Mr. Crawford,
the master of the school, chose to have a house
for a manual training laboratory was simply
that a house offers ampler opportunities than
any other kind of place for instruction in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
practical efficiencies of daily living for both
sexes.</i></p>
<p>The system will be complete when the girls
get a bigger training in design by making more
of the chairs, and when the boys get a bigger
training in diet by doing more of the cooking.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>We have now glanced at each of the three
principal contributions made to modern education
by the new study of the home. We have
come to understand that much of each contribution
will be for the male as well as for the
female inhabitants of the home. If girls are to
be led toward wisdom in the use of money, so
are boys. If girls are to be habituated to the
principles of Right Living, so again are boys.
If girls have a need of manual training, with
certain materials and implements, so boys, with
perhaps other materials and implements, have
a need of manual training, too.</p>

<p>It may be that in each case, except the last,
there will be an ampler body of instruction for
feminine than for masculine use. But the excess
will be small enough to be absorbed without
interference with general education of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
largest and most liberal sort. If this were not
true by natural fact, it would have to be made
true artificially. The body of home economics
instruction could not be suffered to defeat its
own ultimate mental purpose. The study of
specialized techniques could not be permitted
to narrow the spacious educational experience
needed for that broadest of all generalities, the
homemaker&#8217;s intelligent Consumption, Enjoyment,
Use of all the world&#8217;s physical and spiritual
commodities.</p>
<p>Surely we can now say with unanimous consent
that Home Economics has revealed itself
to be not a species of sex education but a species
of vocational education. We miss its inmost intent,
and we divert it from its mission, if we
start with saying &#8220;Let us teach girls.&#8221; We
have to start with saying &#8220;Let us teach Foods,
Textiles, Hygiene.&#8221; We then ask &#8220;Who need
to know about Foods, Textiles, Hygiene?&#8221; In
answer, our largest group of scholars will come
from among the prospective managers of households.
But we are not teaching feminine accomplishments.
We are teaching human life-tasks.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>Widening with this vocational principle,
Miss Goodrich&#8217;s vision of the inclusion of both
sexes in the courses of study now labeled &#8220;domestic-science-and-art&#8221;
finds widening fulfilment.
Side by side with young women in the
Foods laboratory we shall see young men who
are going to be chefs, dietitians, pure-food inspectors.
In the Textiles laboratory we shall
see young women who are going to sew at home,
young women who are going to sew in factories,
young men who are going to manufacture cloth.
Hygiene will attract the sanitarian, the nurse,
the hotel manager, trousered or petticoated.</p>
<p>We come thus face to face with the final development
of the home economics movement.
It issues into a double system. After providing,
to the young, that general introduction to life
at large which we have already detailed, it goes
on, in its second phase, to provide immediate
information of a more specialized character to
scholars more mature <i>at the time when that
information is immediately needed</i>. A large
part of the home economics movement of the
future will be the establishment of a system
of continuous instruction for wives, mothers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
housekeepers, already entered upon their task
of home-making and child-rearing.</p>
<p>The need of this development appears as soon
as we take the sequence of events in a girl&#8217;s life
and place it beside the sequence of events in
a boy&#8217;s. If a boy is going to be a cotton-machinery
engineer, a municipal sanitary expert,
a food specialist, we do not give him his real
technical finish till he is entering his trade. We
may have given him, we ought to have given
him, a vocational foundation of pertinent knowledge.
But we do not give him the minuti&#230; of
trade technique till he is at the point of practicing
his trade or has already begun to practice
it. This principle, applicable to the preparation
for all trades whatsoever, sets limits to the
amount of detailed preparation for home-making
which can profitably be introduced, for most
girls, into the curricula of schools and colleges.</p>
<p>In former chapters of this book we have seen
that for most girls there is a gap, a large gap,
between school and marriage, between girlhood
and motherhood. We have seen, too, that this
gap tends to be filled with money-earning work
which demands a certain preparation of its own.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
That point aside, however, the very existence of
the gap in question, no matter how it may be
filled, means that if we give a minute and elaborate
preparation of home-making to girlhood
we may wait five years, ten years, fifteen years,
twenty years, before we see wifehood and motherhood
put that preparation to use.</p>
<p>Anybody who proposed to give a boy a minute
and elaborate preparation for civil engineering
a possible twenty years before he became a civil
engineer and in contempt of the possible contingency
of his not becoming a civil engineer at
all, would hardly deserve to be called practical.
Yet, in the name of practical education, we are
sometimes asked to tolerate a correspondingly
complete preparation for wifehood and motherhood
at an age when both of those estates are
mere prospects, distant and indefinite. We cannot
believe that so extreme a demand will ever
be acceded to by educators who have fully considered
the modern postponement of marriage.
Home economics, in schools and colleges, except
for girls who are going to become teachers of
it or who in other ways are going to make it
their immediate money-earning work, must stop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
with its broad applications to daily human living.
So will it be useful, in different degrees,
to both sexes and clash neither with general academic
preparation nor with the preparation for
self-support.</p>
<p>There will remain, unlearned, a great deal
that modern science and modern sociology have
to offer to the wife and mother. Let that great
deal, in its more technical teachings, be learned
when it can be carried forward into action.</p>
<p>The machinery of home economics instruction
for adults is even now being erected, is even
now being operated.</p>
<p>The Chicago School of Domestic Arts and
Science, after much teaching of young girls,
has established a &#8220;Housekeepers&#8217; Association.&#8221;
The members of that association are adult practicing
housekeepers. The same school will soon
establish a course in the study of the Care of
Children. The pupils enrolled in that course
will be mothers.</p>
<p>The fact is that science and sociology are so
constantly amending and enlarging their teachings
that a knowledge of what they taught
twenty years ago is inadequate and a knowledge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
of the minuti&#230; of what they taught twenty years
ago is futile. The housekeeper of the future
will have to keep on studying while housekeeping.</p>
<p>Several hundred housekeepers come each winter
to the University of Wisconsin to attend the
&#8220;Women&#8217;s Course in Home Economics.&#8221; They
hear Professor Hastings talk about the &#8220;Production
and Care of Milk.&#8221; They hear Dr.
Evans talk about the &#8220;Prevention of Infant
Mortality.&#8221; They hear Professor Marlatt talk
about &#8220;Diets in Disease.&#8221; In each case they
hear something very different from what they
would have heard in their girlhood. For this
reason alone, even if the gap between girlhood
and motherhood did not exist, the machinery of
home economics instruction for adults would
have become necessary.</p>

<p>It is for adults that the United States Government
issues such bulletins as &#8220;Modern Conveniences
for the Farm Home.&#8221; It is for adults
that Cornell University sends out its Farmers&#8217;
Wives&#8217; Bulletins in editions of twenty thousand.
It is for adults that Columbia University
prints pamphlets like &#8220;The Feeding of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
Children in a Family with an Income of $800
a Year.&#8221;</p>
<p>For adults, again, are such institutions as the
American School of Home Economics, in Chicago,
which, in the few years of its life, has
enrolled more than 10,000 pupils in its correspondence
courses.</p>
<p>For adults, finally, are the Homemakers&#8217;
Conferences held in conjunction with Farmers&#8217;
Institutes as well as the extension-course lectures
given to local groups in city and in country
by teachers sent out from state universities
and agricultural colleges.</p>
<p>All this machinery, which here we do not
attempt to describe but only to indicate, will
some day find its scattered units associated and
harmonized through the work of a Federal
Bureau of Domestic Science and Art. Bills
for the establishment of such a bureau have
already been introduced into Congress. It will
not be a cooking and sewing school for children.
It will be a technical continuation school for
adults. The National Congress of Mothers discerned
one of its functions when it said: &#8220;The
time has come when every nation through a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
special department should provide data concerning
infants which may be used by mothers
everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of chapter two of this book we
asked whether or not, in the field of education,
the training for the home and the training for
self-support would impose a double burden on
the girl pupil. If our interpretation of the
spirit of the home economics movement has been
correct we may now say that the training for
the home is so largely a training for life in general
and is so distributed through different life-periods
that it will not be felt to be burdensome
at all. We may even go on to suggest that self-support
and housekeeping, world and home, and
the trainings for them, will merge for the girl
into a progressive unified experience.</p>
<p>First. That part of home economics which
can profitably be taught to the mass of pupils in
elementary and high school and in the colleges,
with its manual arts, its Right Living and its
money-sense, will be helpful, much of it, to boys
as well as to girls and will actually, since it develops
the whole personality of the pupil, be
part of the training for self-support itself.</p>

<p>Second. The years spent in self-support, in
learning the world, will be part of the training
for the home, because hereafter, as the Mary of
our first chapter remarked, the mother who does
not know the world cannot wisely rear boys up
into it.</p>
<p>Third. After the period of self-support,
when marriage comes, what further technical
instruction the housekeeper and mother may
need will be furnished to her by a system of
adult education limitless in its possible growth.</p>

<p>It got talked around among Marie&#8217;s friends
that she didn&#8217;t want children.</p>
<p>This was considered very surprising, in view
of all that her father and husband had done
for her.</p>
<p>Here is what they had done for her:</p>
<p>They had removed from her life all need,
and finally all desire, to make efforts and to accomplish
results through struggle in defiance
of difficulty and at the cost of pain.</p>
<p>Work and pain were the two things Marie
was on no account to be exposed to. With this
small but important reservation:</p>
<p>She might <i>work</i> at <i>avoiding</i> pain.</p>
<p>When the cook had a headache she took
Getting Breakfast for it. When Marie had a
headache she worked not at breakfast but at the
headache.</p>
<p>It was a social ceremony of large proportions,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
with almost everybody among those present,
from the doctor down through Mother and
Auntie to Little Sister. The decorations, which
were very elaborate, comprised, besides the
usual tasteful arrangement of thermometers,
eau-de-Karlsbad, smelling-salts bottles, cracked
ice, and chocolate creams, a perfect shower of
tourmaline roses, the odor of which, alone
among all the vegetable odors in the world, had
been found after long experimentation to be
soothing to Marie on such occasions. It was
not thought that Marie could vanquish a headache
except after a plucky fight of at least one
day&#8217;s duration.</p>
<p>Actresses go on and do their turns day after
day and night after night with hardly a miss.
Marie&#8217;s troubles were no more numerous than
theirs. But they were much larger. Troubles
are like gases. They expand to fill any void
into which they are introduced. Marie&#8217;s spread
themselves through a vacuum as large as her
life.</p>
<p>The making of that vacuum and the inserting
of Marie into it cost her father and her husband
prodigious toil and was a great pleasure to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
them. Marie belonged to the Leisure Class. Socially,
she was therefore distinctly superior to
her father and her husband.</p>

WORK? FOR MARIE? FOR MY DAUGHTER? SHOCKING!<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>President Thomas of Bryn</span> Mawr had Marie
in mind when she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;By the leisured class we mean in America
the class whose men work harder than any other
men in the excitement of professional and commercial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
rivalry, but whose women constitute
the only leisured class we have and the most
leisured class in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marie&#8217;s father wasn&#8217;t so very rich, either.
He was engaged in a business so vividly competitive
that Marie&#8217;s brother was hurried
through college as fast as possible and brought
into the game at twenty-two with every nerve
stretched taut.</p>
<p>Nothing like that was expected of Marie.
She was brought up to think that leisure was
woman&#8217;s natural estate. Work, for any girl, she
regarded as an accident due to the unexpected
and usually reprehensible collapse of the males
of the poor girl&#8217;s family.</p>
<p>This view of the matter gave Marie, <i>unconsciously
to herself</i>, what morality she had.
Hard drinking, &#8220;illegitimate&#8221; gambling, and
excessive dissipations of all sorts are observed
commonly to have a prejudicial effect on male
efficiency and on family prosperity. Against all
&#8220;vices,&#8221; therefore (although she didn&#8217;t catch
the &#8220;therefore&#8221;), Marie was a Moral Force of
a million angel-power.</p>
<p>Aside from &#8220;vices,&#8221; however, all kinds of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
conduct looked much alike to her. Ethics is the
rules of the game, the decencies of the struggle
for existence. Marie had no part in the struggle.
She violated its decencies without being
at all aware of it.</p>
<p>All the way, for instance, from stealing a
place in the line in front of a box-office window
ahead of ten persons who were there before
her, up the tiny scale of petty aggressions within
her narrow reach to the cool climax of spending
three months every summer in a pine-wood
mountain resort (thus depriving her city-bound
husband of the personal companionship which
was the one best thing she had to give him in
return for what he gave her), she was as competent
a little grafter as the town afforded.</p>
<p>But she was a perfectly logical one. Her
family had trained her to deadhead her way
through life and she did it. Finally she went
beyond their expectations. They hadn&#8217;t quite
anticipated all of the sweetly undeviating inertia
of her mind.</p>
<p>Nevertheless she was a nice girl. In fact,
she was The Nice Girl. She was sweet-tempered,
sweet-mannered, and sweet-spoken&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
perfect dear. She never did a &#8220;bad&#8221; thing in
her life. And she never ceased from her career
of moral forcing. She wrote to her husband
from her mountain fastness, warning him
against high-balls in hot weather. She went
twice a month during the winter to act as librarian
for an evening at a settlement in a district
which was inhabited by perfectly respectable
working people but which, while she passed out
the books, she sympathetically alluded to as a
&#8220;slum.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is hardly fair, however, to lay the whole
explanation of Marie on her father, her husband,
and herself.</p>
<p>A few years ago, in the churchyard of St.
Philip&#8217;s Church at Birmingham, they set up a
tombstone which had fallen down, and they reinscribed
it in honor of the long-neglected
memory of the man who had been resting beneath
it for a century and a half. His name was
Wyatt. John Wyatt. He had a good deal to
do with making Marie what she was.</p>
<p>What toil, what tossing nights, what sweating
days, what agonized wrenching of the imagination
toward a still unreached idea, have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
gone into the making of leisure&mdash;for other
people!</p>
<p>Wyatt strained toward, and touched, the idea
which was the real start of modern leisure.</p>
<p>In the year 1733, coming from the cathedral
town of Lichfield, where the Middle Ages still
lingered, he set up, in a small building near
Sutton Coldfields, a certain machine. That
machine inaugurated, and forever symbolizes,
the long and glorious series of mechanical triumphs
which has made a large degree of leisure
possible, not for a few thousand women, as
was previously the case, but for millions and
millions of them.</p>
<p>It was only about two feet square. But
it accomplished a thing never before accomplished.
It spun the first thread ever spun in
the history of the world without the intervention
of human fingers.</p>
<p>On that night woman lost her oldest and most
significant title and function. The Spinster
ceased to be.</p>
<p>The mistress and her maid, spinning together
in the Hall, their fingers drawing the roving
from the distaff and stretching it out as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
spindle twisted it, were finally on the point of
separating forever.</p>
<p>We all see what Wyatt&#8217;s machine did to the
maids. We all understand that when he started
his mill at Birmingham and hired his working
force of <i>ten girls</i>, he prophesied the factory
&#8220;slum.&#8221;</p>
<p>We do not yet realize what he did to the
mistresses, how he utterly changed their character
and how he marvelously increased their
number.</p>
<p>But look! His machine, with the countless
machines which followed it, in the spinning
industry and in all other industries, made it possible
to organize masses of individuals into industrial
regiments which required captains and
majors and colonels and generals. It created
the need of leadership, of <i>multitudinous</i> leadership.
And with leadership came the rewards
of leadership. And the wives and daughters of
the leaders (a race of men previously, by comparison,
nonexistent) arose in thousands and
hundreds of thousands and millions to live in
leisure and semi-leisure on the fruits of the new
system.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>While the maids went to the &#8220;slums,&#8221; the
mistresses went to the suburbs.</p>
<p>What did Wyatt get out of it? Imprisonment
for debt and the buzz of antiquarians
above his rotted corpse.</p>
<p>Wyatt and his equally humble successors in
genius, Hargreaves and Crompton, artisans!
Where in history shall we find men the world
took more from, gave less to?</p>
<p>To Hargreaves, inventing the spinning-jenny,
a mob and a flight from Lancashire, a wrecked
machine and a sacked house! To Crompton,
inventing the spinning-mule (which, in simulating,
surpassed the delicate pulling motion
of the spinster&#8217;s arm)&mdash;to Crompton, poverty
so complete that the mule, patient bearer of
innumerable fortunes to investors, was surrendered
to them unpatented, while its maker retired
to his &#8220;Hall-in-the-Wood&#8221; and his workman
wages!</p>
<p>Little did Wyatt and Hargreaves and
Crompton eat of the bread of idleness they
built the oven for.</p>
<p>But Arkwright! There was the man who
foreshadowed, in his own career, the new aristocracy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
about to be evoked by the new machinery.
He made spinning devices of his own.
He used everybody else&#8217;s devices. He patented
them all. He lied in the patents. He sued infringers
of them. He overlooked his defeats in
the courts. He bit and gouged and endured
and invented and organized till, from being a
barber and dealing in hair-dyes and bargaining
for the curls of pretty girls at country fairs, he
ended up Sir Richard Arkwright and&mdash;last
perfect touch in a fighting career&mdash;was building
a church when he died.</p>
<p>And his son was England&#8217;s richest commoner.</p>
<p>It was the dawn of the day of common richness.</p>
<p>The new aristocracy was as hospitably large
as the old aristocracy had been sternly small.
Before Wyatt, leisure had been the thinnest of
exhalations along the very top of society. Since
Wyatt, it has got diffused in greater and greater
density through at least the upper third of it.
And for all that magical extension of free time,
wrested from the ceaseless toil with which God
cursed Adam, we stand indebted (and so recently!)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
to the machinery <i>set</i> going by that
spontaneous explosion of artisan genius in England
only a hundred and fifty years ago, <i>kept</i>
going (and faster and faster) by the labor of
men, women, and children behind factory windows,
the world over, to-day.</p>
<p>Marie&#8217;s view of the situation, however, is the
usual one. We are billions of miles from really
realizing that leisure is produced by somebody&#8217;s
work, that just &#8220;Being a Good Woman&#8221; or
&#8220;Being a Decent Fellow&#8221; is so far from being
an adequate return for the toil of other people
that it is just exactly no return at all. We are
billions of miles from admitting that the virtuous
parasite is just as much a parasite as the
vicious parasite:&mdash;that the former differs from
the latter in the use of the money but not at all
in the matter of getting it in return for nothing.</p>
<p>Getting something for nothing is the fundamental
immorality of the world. But we don&#8217;t
believe it. There will be a revolution before
we get it into our heads that trying to trade a
sweet disposition or an intelligent appreciation
of opera or a proficiency at amateur tennis for
three meals a day is a fraud.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>Marie didn&#8217;t mean to commit a fraud. She
just dropped a sentimental, non-negotiable
plugged nickel into the slot-machine of life
and drew out a motor-car and a country place,
and was innocently pleased. Such a wonderful
slot-machine! She never saw the laboring multitudes
behind it, past and present multitudes,
dead fingers, living fingers, big men&#8217;s fingers,
little children&#8217;s fingers, pulling the strings, delivering
the prizes, laying aside the plugged
nickel in the treasury of a remote revenge.</p>

TO CURE A HEADACHE&mdash;WORKING-GIRL THERAPY: TAKE A GOOD JOB AND STIR IT CONSTANTLY FROM BREAKFAST TO SUPPER.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>Perhaps the reason</span> why she didn&#8217;t catch on
to the fact that, instead of being the world&#8217;s
creditor, she was really inhabiting an almshouse
was that she was so busy.</p>
<p>You see, she not only did things all the time
but she had to find and invent them to do. Her
life, even before she was married, was much
more difficult than her brother&#8217;s, who simply
got up in the morning and took the same old
7.42 to the same old office.</p>
<p>When he wanted clothes he went to the nearest
decent tailor.</p>
<p>No such cinch for Marie. Her tailor lived
in Sutherton, on the directly opposite side of the
city from the suburb in which Marie lived.
Just to get to that tailor&#8217;s cost Marie an hour
and a half of effort. She had got up early, but
by the time the tailor had stuck the world&#8217;s visible
supply of pins into the lines of her new coat,
most of the forenoon had been arduously occupied.</p>
<p>Of course many forenoons had to be thus
occupied. Never forget it! The modish adaptation
of woven fabrics to the female contour
becomes increasingly complex and minute and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
exacting and time-occupying in precise proportion
as the amount of time increases for which
occupation must be devised.</p>
<p>Besides, it gives employment to the tailors.</p>
<p>This is the really meritorious function of the
leisure class. It gives employment. And every
extension of its tastes and needs gives more employment.
Marie and her friends greatly increased
the number and prosperity of tailors
and milliners and candy-dippers and perfume-manufacturers
and manicurists and hairdressers
and plumed-bird hunters and florists and cab-drivers
and Irish lace-makers and Chinese silkworm
tenders and violet-and-orris sachet-powder
makers and matine heroes and French
nuns who embroider underwear and fur-traders
and pearl-divers and other deserving persons,
not forgetting the multitudes of Turks who
must make nougat or perish.</p>
<p>In fact, Marie and her friends, in the course
of a year, gave as much employment as a fair-sized
earthquake. That is, in the course of a
year, they destroyed, without return, a large
amount of wealth and set many people to work
replacing it. If we had a large enough leisure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
class we should have no need of fires and railroad
wrecks and the other valuable events
which increase our prosperity by consuming it.</p>
<p>Marie belonged to the real Consumers&#8217;
League. And she consumed prettily and virtuously.
It wasn&#8217;t bad air that suffocated her
soul. It was no air.</p>

</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>She thought she was</span> breathing, however, and
breathing fast. Why, it was half past eleven
before she got back downtown from her tailor,
and she bought a wedding present till one, and
she was just famished and ran to a tea room, but
she had hardly touched a mouthful when she
remembered there was a girl from out of town
who had come in to spend a month doing nothing
and had to be helped, but though she rushed
to the &#8217;phone she couldn&#8217;t get her friend before
it was time to catch her suburban train home;
in order to do which she jumped into the station
&#8217;bus, only to remember she had forgotten
to buy a ribbon for her Siamese costume for the
Benefit Ball; but it was too late now and she
spent her time, going out on the train, trying
to think of some way of getting along without
it, and her head began to ache; but luckily she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
met some of the girls on her way from the station
to her high-school sorority alumn&#230; reunion
and they began to tell her how to do it; but she
had to hurry away because she had promised to
go to the house of one of the girls and do stencil
patterns, which started to be beautiful, but
before she could get any of them really done
she recollected that Chunk Brown had sent
over a bunch of new songs and was coming to
call to-night and she had to scoot home and
practice &#8220;June time is moon time and tune time
and spoon time,&#8221; as well as &#8220;The grass is blue
o&#8217;er little Sue,&#8221; till there was just one hour left
before dinner and she was perfectly crazy over
the new &#8220;do&#8221; which one of the girls had
showed her and she rushed upstairs and went
at that &#8220;do&#8221; and by dinner time she had got it
almost right, so that her father told her always to
do her hair like that and brother wished he had
it down at the factory to replace a broken dynamo
brush, while as for Chunk, he was nicer
than ever till he learned he had to take her to
a rehearsal of the Siamese Group for the Benefit
Ball: so that, what with having to coax him to
go and what with changing into her costume,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
she got to the rehearsal so tired she couldn&#8217;t
stand up to go through the figures till she
caught sight of the celebrated &#230;sthete, the
Swami Ram Chandra Gunga Din, who was
there to hand out the right slants about oriental
effects and who had persuaded Marie there was
great consolation to be found in realizing that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
life is a spiral and that therefore you can&#8217;t make
progress straight up but must go round and
round through rhythmic alternations of joy and
sorrow, which caused Chunk to relapse again
from his attentiveness but which pleased Marie
greatly because she was always unhappy in between
two periods of happiness and therefore
felt she was getting along the spiral and into
Culture pretty well, till it was eleven o&#8217;clock
and she waked Chunk up out of a chair in the
hall and made him take her home; and he said
the Swami was a <i>very clever</i> man and she said
American men had no culture and didn&#8217;t understand
women, and Chunk didn&#8217;t even say
good night to her, and she went to sleep crying,
and remembering she hadn&#8217;t after all learned
from the girls how to get along without that
ribbon in her costume and she must get up early
and buy it, which made her utter one final little
plaintive sniffle of vexation.</p>
<p>It was a nice child&#8217;s life, full of small things
which looked big, uncorrected in its view of
love, culture, charity, or anything else by any
carrying of the burdens, enduring of the shocks,
or thrilling to the triumphs, of a really adult
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
life. Her brother, when he went to work, was
her junior. In five years he was much her
senior. (You may verify this by observation
among your own acquaintances.) Marie was
not a minute older now than when she left
school. Talking to her at twenty-six was exactly
the same experience as talking to her at
twenty-one. That was what the world, from
John Wyatt to her father, had done for her.</p>

SEE THE PROUD HUSBAND. HE DID IT ALL HIMSELF.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>From such a life</span> there are necessarily revulsions.
The empty leisure of the Nice Girl is
quite successfully total waste. But it becomes
intolerable to that waster who, though not desiring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
genuine occupation, desires genuine sensation.</p>
<p>Hence smart sets.</p>
<p>Every social group in which there is much
leisure has its own smart set. There may be a
million dollars a year to spend. There may be
only a few thousands. But there is always a
smart set.</p>
<p>How suddenly its smartness may follow its
leisure, how accurately its plunge into luxury
may duplicate the suddenness of modern luxury
itself, you may observe with your own eyes
almost anywhere.</p>
<p>You see a little crowd of women come into
the Mandarin Tea Room of the St. DuBarry in
Novellapolis in the fresh West. When they remove
their automobile veils you see that they
were once, and very recently, the nicest sort of
members of the sewing circle and the W. C. T.
U. of Lone Tree Crossing.</p>
<p>When the waiter comes along with their
cocktails and they begin to sip them out of their
tea cups, you wake up with a jerk to realize
that it&#8217;s half past three in the afternoon and the
evening has begun.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>How rapid it all is!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s Margaret Simpson. A few years
ago you might have seen her pumping the water
for Jim&#8217;s breakfast, cleaning the lamps, and
picking bugs off the potato vines.</p>
<p>Jim came to town. He struck it poor. Then
he struck it rich. He owns a bunch of moving-picture
places. He manufactures a patented
bottle-stopper. He&#8217;s a pavement contractor.
His wife has just as much leisure as any
duchess.</p>
<p>The duchess has her individual estate and
resources, which make it possible for her to lead
an almost complete social life within her own
walls. But never mind! Margaret has the
Downtown District, coperatively owned, coperatively
maintained, magnificently equipped
with bright boudoirs in the rest rooms of the
department stores, with wonderful conservatories
where one may enter and gaze and pay
no more attention to the florist than to one&#8217;s own
gardener, with sumptuous drawing-rooms, like
the Purple Parlor of the St. DuBarry, with
body-servants in the beauty shops, with coachmen
on the taxicabs, with seclusion in the Ladies&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
Department of the Novellapolis Athletic
Club&mdash;an infinitely resourceful estate, which
Margaret knows as intimately as the duchess
knows hers.</p>
<p>This morning she hunted down a new reduction
plant on the eighteenth floor of the Beauty
Block and weighed in at 185 on the white
enamel scales. After an hour of Thermo-Vibro-Magneto-Magenta-Edison-Company
light therapy,
she weighed out at 182-6.</p>
<p>At luncheon she ate only pure of tomatoes,
creamed chicken and sweetbreads, Boston
bread and butter, orange punch and Lady Baltimore
cake, severely cutting out the potatoes.</p>
<p>After luncheon she spent an hour in a tiny
room which had mirrors all around it and a
maid (as trim and French-accented as any maid
any duchess could have) and a couple of fitters
and a head fitter. It ended up with: &#8220;Do you
mean to tell me that after all the reducing and
dieting I&#8217;ve been doing I can&#8217;t wear under a
twenty-seven? It&#8217;s ridiculous. I tell you what.
Measure me for a made-to-order. These stock
sizes all run large. If it&#8217;s made to order I can
wear a twenty-six as easy as anybody.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>Then she met up with her friends at the
St. DuBarry.</p>
<p>You watch the waiter bring another round
of drinks and you perceive that the evening
is well under way and that the peak of the
twenty-four hours is being disputatiously approached.</p>
<p>It appears that Perinique&#8217;s is a swell place
to dine, but that the cheese is bad. The cheese
is good right here at the St. DuBarry, but they
don&#8217;t know how to toast the biscuits. At the
Grnewurst the waiters are poor. At Max&#8217;s
the soup is always cold. The mural decorations
at the Prince Eitel are so gloomy they give you
a chill.</p>
<p>Despair settles down on the scene. There
seems to be no likelihood that there will be any
dinner at all anywhere. In the absence, however,
of that kind of good cheer, another kind is
spread on the table when the inquiry is flung
down whether or not the way in which Jim
looked at Dora last night has been generally
observed.</p>
<p>You conclude that poor, dear, innocent Dora
ought not to have been looked at in that way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
You were hasty. Nobody is innocent in the
Mandarin Tea Room of the St. DuBarry, when
not there. Dora, you soon learn, deserves to be
looked at in any and all ways. It&#8217;s not for her
that we&#8217;re worried. It&#8217;s for Jim.</p>
<p>At the name of Jim, Margaret begins to look
uncomfortable and helpless. She sinks lower
and lower into her chair; and says nothing; and
keeps on saying nothing; and seems likely to
drown in silence; but her friends start in to
rescue her. You can&#8217;t help seeing some of the
life-lines as they are thrown out.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were <i>you</i>, Margaret, and <i>my</i> husband
behaved to <i>me</i> as Jim is behaving to <i>you</i>,
<i>I&#8217;d</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you married Jim, Margaret, you
were the prettiest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder Dora&#8217;s husband divorced her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder she wouldn&#8217;t confine herself to
making trouble for her own husbands without&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble with you, Margaret, is that
you&#8217;re too good to Jim, letting him run around
with Dora and not doing anything yourself. If
you had any sense you&#8217;d make him so jealous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
he&#8217;d walk on his hands and hold a loaf of sugar
on his nose for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Fannie, why don&#8217;t you tell your friend
Ned to cut in here and pay a little attention to
Marge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ned&#8217;s no good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll tell my husband to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do it! I started my husband once
on a thing like that and he went at it so strong&mdash;Choose a bachelor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Ned&#8217;s not married. Let him
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody ought to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Fannie, call Ned on the &#8217;phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll be back in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Marge, we&#8217;ll eat at the Royal Gorge
and I&#8217;ll put you and Ned side by side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And <i>I&#8217;ll</i> sit next to your husband and tell
him how strong Ned is with the ladies. He&#8217;ll
take a good look all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now buck up, Marge, and encourage Ned
a little. Don&#8217;t be a fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, Marge, you&#8217;ll do a lot more with
Jim by cutting up a little bit than by all this
dieting you&#8217;re trying to do.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Say, Marge, it&#8217;s a good thing you&#8217;ve got
on your white broadcloth and your willow
plumes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get &#8217;em at Delatour&#8217;s now for
twenty-five dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Fannie, did you get Ned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got him all right, but what do you think?
He&#8217;s got another date for to-night, so he can&#8217;t
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, flam!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, here&#8217;s Dora now, as usual. I
suppose she&#8217;ll try to butt in.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she doesn&#8217;t. She just hesitates beside the
table long enough to say: &#8220;Got to sweep right
along, girlies. Going to buzz out to the Inland
Inn for dinner with Ned. Yep. What&#8217;s the
matter? You know Ned. Our old friend Ned.
The same. He&#8217;s waiting for me now. G&#8217;bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Talk of nerve! You have to hand it to that
Dora girl!</p>
<p>Exit Dora. Enter Jim and five or six other
men, mostly husbands to the women already
present.</p>
<p>Jim begins by asking if anybody has seen
Dora. The ensemble tells him not only that but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
everything else about Dora. Harry orders a
round of drinks. So does Charlie. Somebody
praises the drawn-butter sauce at the Suddington.
This is met with the merits of the pineapple
parfait at the La Fontaine. Jim orders a
round of drinks. Jim is willing to eat his hat
if Dora&#8217;s divorce wasn&#8217;t her husband&#8217;s fault.
Must have been. Never saw the husband. But
Dora&#8217;s character! Jim drinks off one of the
cocktails standing in front of his right-hand
neighbor Frank, and returns to Dora&#8217;s character.
No straighter little girl ever came to this
town. On hearing this from her husband, Margaret
gets up and leaves the Tea Room and goes
to the Purple Parlor and cries. Fannie takes her
opportunity and begins to tell Jim how attentive
Ned has been lately to Margaret. This is so
helpful that Jim drinks off another of Frank&#8217;s
cocktails and runs to the Purple Parlor to find
Margaret. She&#8217;s still crying. He thinks she&#8217;s
crying because Ned is away with Dora. He rebukes
her. In King Arthur&#8217;s vein. Is he not
her husband? Woman, tell him that. But dignity
soon tapers off with him into the &#8220;Now I
warn you to cut it out&#8221; of the tyrannical manikin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
with a cinder in the eye of his self-conceit.
Their friends hear them quarreling and follow
them into the Purple Parlor. There&#8217;s a terrible
row in the Purple Parlor. The Purple Parlor
is full of persons explaining. Fannie explains.
Charlie explains. Each person explains, individually,
to each other person, individually.
Each couple reaches a satisfactory explanation.
But, somehow, when they start to explain that
explanation to the next couple, it vanishes.
Everybody runs about trying to find it. The
waiter runs about trying to find the gen&#8217;l&#8217;man
to pay for the undrunk drinks back in the Tea
Room. Frank, being the only member of the
party who hasn&#8217;t been drinking, can&#8217;t help seeing
what the waiter means. He pays the bill.
Then he exerts himself like a sheep-dog and
runs the whole crowd down the corridor and out
into a couple of taxicabs. The air reminds them
of unsatisfied appetites. Conjugal problems are
things of the past. As the taxicabs jump out
from the curb to the street-center everybody&#8217;s
head is out of window and everybody&#8217;s voice is
saying &#8220;The Suddington,&#8221; &#8220;The Grnewurst,&#8221;
&#8220;Max&#8217;s,&#8221; &#8220;The Royal Gorge,&#8221; &#8220;Perinique&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>The revulsion from empty leisure in the direction
of full-every-night leisure is balanced
to some extent by a revulsion toward activity
of a useful sort. This latter revulsion has two
phases: Economic Independence, which has been
spoken of in former chapters; Social Service
and Citizenship, which will be spoken of in the
next chapter.</p>
<p>Which one of these two revulsions will be
the stronger? If it is the one toward useful activity,
we shall see a dam erected against the
current which, in carrying women out of the
struggle for existence, carries them out of the
world&#8217;s mental life. If it is the one toward
frivolity, we shall see simply an acceleration of
that current and a quicker and larger departure
from all those habits of toil and of service which
produce power and character.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>With marriage, of course, Marie had a certain
opportunity to get back into life. She had
before her at least fifteen years of real work.
And it would have been work of the realest
sort. Effort&mdash;to and beyond all other effort!
The carrying of new life in fear, the delivery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
of it in torture, the nourishing of it in relinquishment
of all the world&#8217;s worldliness, the
watching over it in sleeplessness, the healing of
its sickness in heart-sickness, the bringing of it,
with its body strong, its mind matured, up into
the world of adults, up into the struggle for existence!
What a work!</p>
<p>But what a preparation for it had Marie!</p>
<p>She flinched from it. The inertia of her
mind carried her to the ultimate logic of her
life. Along about the time of her marriage she
began to cease to be the typical normal girl of
her type.</p>
<p>She became a woman of the future&mdash;<i>of her
type</i>.</p>
<p>From the facts of modern leisure the positive
character reacts toward novel activity. It may
be a reaction toward Civic Service. Or toward
Self-Support. Or toward an enormous never-before-witnessed
expenditure of intelligent care
on the physical and mental education of children.
The positive character, fighting modern
facts, creates new ideals. The character which
is neither positive nor negative runs along as a
neutral mixture of the old ideals and of the modern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
facts, of child-rearing made amateurish by
idling and of idling made irritable by child-rearing.
The negative character&mdash;like Marie&#8217;s&mdash;just
yields to the modern facts and is swept
along by them into final irresponsibility and
inutility.</p>
<p>But Marie wasn&#8217;t negative enough&mdash;she
wasn&#8217;t <i>emotional</i> enough in her negativeness&mdash;to
plunge into <i>dissipation</i>. It wasn&#8217;t in her nature
to do any <i>plunging</i> of any kind. Good, safe,
motionless <i>sponging</i> was her instinct. And she
will die in the odor of tubbed and scrubbed respectability.
And if you knew her you would
like her very much. She is charming.</p>
<p>When she and Chunk were married, they
went to live in an apartment appropriate to a
rising young man, and Marie&#8217;s job was on all
occasions to look as appropriate as the apartment.</p>
<p>No shallow cynicism, this! Just plain, bald
truth without any wig on it. The only thing
that you could put your finger on that Marie
really did was so to wear clothes and so to give
parties as to be the barometer of her husband&#8217;s
prosperity. And in every city you can see lots
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
of such barometers giving themselves an artificially
high reading in order to create that
&#8220;atmosphere&#8221; of success which is a recognized
commercial asset.</p>
<p>Chunk was hugely pleased with Marie. She
looked good at the dinner table in the caf of
their apartment building. She knew how to
order the right dishes when they entertained
and dined down town. She made it possible for
him to return deftly and engagingly the social
attentions of older people. She completed the
&#8220;front&#8221; of his life, and he not only supported
her but, as Miss Salmon, of Vassar, flippantly
and seriously says, he &#8220;sported&#8221; her as he
might a diamond shirt stud.</p>
<p>No struggle in Marie&#8217;s life so far! No
<i>having</i> to swim in the cold water of daily enforced
duty or else sink. <i>No being accustomed
to the disagreeable feel of that water.</i></p>
<p>She had missed work. That was nothing.
She had missed being <i>hardened</i> to work. That
was everything.</p>
<p>The first demand ever made on her for really
disagreeable effort came when Chunk, in order
to get a new factory going, had to move for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
while to Junction City. When Marie bitterly
and furiously objected, Chunk was severely astonished.
Why, he had to go! It was necessary.
But there had been no necessity in Marie&#8217;s
experience. They became quarrelsome
about it. Then stubborn. Marie talked about
her mother and her friends and how she loved
them (which was true) and stayed.</p>
<p>For two years she inhabited Chunk&#8217;s flat in
the city and lived on Chunk&#8217;s monthly check.</p>
<p>She and Chunk were married. Chunk was
to support her. He was the man nearest to her.
Her father had once supported her. Her job
then had been Being Nice. Her father had supported
her for that, even after she had grown up.
Well, she still was nice. And she still was, and
deserved to be, supported. Perfectly logical.</p>
<p>For two years, neither really daughter now
nor really wife, not being obliged any longer
even to make suggestions to her mother about
what to have for dinner, not being obliged any
longer even to think out the parties for Chunk&#8217;s
business friends, she did nothing but become
more and more firmly fixed in her inertia, in her
incapacity for hardship, in her horror of pain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>When Chunk came back from Junction City
and was really convinced that she didn&#8217;t want
children he was not merely astonished. He
thought the world had capsized.</p>
<p>In a way he was right. The world is turning
round and over and back to that one previous
historical era when the aversion to childbearing
was widespread.</p>
<p>Once, just once, before our time, there was a
modern world. Once, just once, though not on
the scale we know it, there was, before us, a diffusion
of leisure.</p>
<p>The causes were similar.</p>
<p>The Romans conquered the world by military
force, just as we have conquered it by mechanical
invention. They lived on the plunder of
despoiled peoples, just as we live on the products
of exploited continents. They had slaves in
multitudes, just as we have machines in masses.
Because of the slaves, there were hundreds of
thousands of their women, in the times of the
Empire, who had only denatured housekeeping
to do, just as to-day there are millions of our
women who, because of machines, have only that
kind of housekeeping to do. Along with leisure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
and semi-leisure, they acquired its consequences,
just as we have acquired them. And the sermons
of Augustus C&#230;sar, first hero of their completed
modernity, against childlessness are perfect precedents
for those of Theodore Roosevelt, first
hero of ours.</p>
<p>Augustus, however, addressed himself mainly
to the men, who entered into marriage late, or
did not enter into it at all, for reasons identical
with ours&mdash;the increased competitiveness of the
modern life and the decreased usefulness of the
modern wife. It was the satirists who addressed
themselves particularly to the women. And
their tirades against idleness, frivolity, luxury,
dissipation, divorce, and aversion to childbearing
leave nothing to be desired, in comparison
with modern efforts, for effectiveness in rhetoric&mdash;or
for ineffectiveness in result.</p>
<p>Now it could not have been the woman who
desires economic independence through self-support
who was responsible for the ultimate
aversion to child-bearing in the Roman world&mdash;for
she did not exist. It could not have
been the woman who desires full citizenship&mdash;for
<i>she</i> did not exist. What economic power and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
what political power the Roman Empire woman
desired and achieved was parasitic&mdash;the economic
power which comes from the inheritance
of estates, the political power which comes from
the exercise of sexual charm.</p>
<p>The one essential difference between the women
of that ancient modern world and the women
of this contemporary modern world is in the
emergence, along with really democratic ideals,
of the agitation for equal economic and political
opportunity.</p>
<p>The other kind of New Woman, the woman
brought up throughout her girlhood in a home
in which there is no adequate employment for
her; trained to no tasks, or, at any rate, to tasks
(like dusting the dining-room and counting the
laundry) so petty, so ridiculously irrelevant that
her great-grandmother did them in the intervals
of her real work, going then into marriage with
none of the discipline of habitual encounter with
inescapable toil; taken by her husband not to
share his struggle but his prosperity&mdash;that sort
of New Woman they had, just as we have her,
in smaller number, it is true, but in identical
character.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>They tell us it was &#8220;luxury&#8221; that ruined the
Romans. But was luxury the <i>start</i>? Wasn&#8217;t it
only the means to the <i>finish</i>?</p>
<p>Eating a grouse destroys, in itself, no more
moral fiber than eating a ham sandwich. Bismarck,
whether he slept on eider down or on
straw, arose Bismarck.</p>
<p>The person who has a job and who does it is
very considerably immunized against the consequences
of luxury. First, because he is giving
a return for it. Second, because he hasn&#8217;t much
time for it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we see the hobo who won&#8217;t
work ruining himself on the luxury of stable
floors and of free-lunch counters, just as thoroughly
as any nobleman who won&#8217;t work can
ever ruin himself on the luxury of castles and
of game preserves.</p>
<p>It is clearly the habitual enjoyment of either
grouse or ham sandwiches, of either eider down
or straw, <i>without service rendered and without
fatigue endured</i>, that ultimately desiccates the
moral character and drains it of all capacity for
effort.</p>
<p>Marie was enervated not by her luxury but by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
her failure to <i>pay</i> for her luxury. She wouldn&#8217;t
have had to pay much. Her luxury was petty.
But she paid nothing. And her failure to pay
was just as big as if her luxury had been bigger.
Getting three thousand a year in return for nothing
leaves you morally just as bankrupt as if you
had got three million.</p>
<p>Marie came to her abdication of life&#8217;s <i>greatest</i>
effort not by wearing too many clothes or by eating
too many foods but by becoming accustomed
to getting clothes and foods and all other things
without the <i>smallest</i> effort.</p>
<p>She had given her early, plastic, formative
years to acquiring the <i>habit</i> of effortless enjoyment,
and when the time for making an effort
came, the effort just wasn&#8217;t in her.</p>
<p>Her complete withdrawal from the struggle
for existence had at last, in her negative, non-resistive
mind, atrophied all the instincts of that
struggle, including finally the instinct for reproduction.</p>
<p>The instinct for reproduction is intricately involved
in the struggle for existence. The individual
struggles for perpetuation, for perpetuation
in person, for perpetuation in posterity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
Work, the perpetuation of one&#8217;s own life in strain
and pain; work, the clinging to existence in spite
of its blows; work, the inuring of the individual
to the penalties of existence, is linked psychologically
to the power and desire for continued
racial life. The individual, the class, which
struggles no more will in the end reproduce
itself no more. In not having had to conquer
life, it has lost its will to live.</p>
<p>The detailed daily reasons for this social law
stand clear in Marie&#8217;s life. It is a strong law.
Its triumph in Marie could have been thwarted
only by the presence in her of a certain other
social law. Authority!</p>
<p>The woman who is coerced by Authority, the
woman who is operated by ideals introduced
into her from without, will bear children even
when she does not feel the active wish to bear
them. She will bear them just because the
authoritative expectation is that she <i>shall</i> bear
them.</p>
<p>But Marie was free!</p>
<p>She was free from the requirement of an heir
for the family estate. The modern form of
property, requiring no male warrior for its defense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
in the next generation, had done that for
her.</p>
<p>She was free from the dictates of historic
Christianity about conjugal duty and unrestricted
reproduction. Modern Protestantism
had done that for her.</p>
<p>She was free from the old uncomplaining
compliance with a husband&#8217;s will. Modern individualism
had done that for her.</p>
<p>She was free! Uncoerced by family authority,
uncoerced by ecclesiastical authority, uncoerced
by marital authority, she was almost
limitlessly free!</p>
<p>There being no <i>external force</i> compelling her
to bear children, she had to follow <i>internal instinct</i>.</p>
<p>That instinct, if it had existed in her, would
have been a sufficient guide. It would have
been a commanding guide. It would have been
the best possible guide. Rising in her from
the original eternal life-power it would have
driven her to child-bearing more surely than she
could have been driven to it by any external
agency whatsoever.</p>
<p>But the instinct toward child-bearing could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
not now be revived in Marie. With the cessation
from struggle and from effort and from fatigue
and from discipline and from the sorrow of pain
that brings the joy of accomplishment, with that
cessation the instinct toward child-bearing had
reached cessation, too. With the petrifaction of
its soil it had withered away.</p>
<p>Nobody had ever tried to bring Marie back
to the soil of struggle. Nobody,&mdash;not her father,
not her mother, not her husband, not one of her
friends, not one of her teachers had ever taught
her to return to life by returning to labor.</p>
<p>The greatest wrong possible to a woman had
been wrought upon her.</p>
<p>She had been sedulously trained out of the life
of the race into race-death.</p>
<p>Yet when it got talked around among her
friends that she didn&#8217;t want children, people
blamed her and said it was very surprising, <i>in
view of all that had been done for her</i>.</p>

<p>Leaning over a tiled parapet, we looked
down at the streak of street so far below.
Motor-cars, crawling&mdash;crawling, glossy-backed
beetles. &#8220;Drop a pin and impale that green
one.&#8221; One couldn&#8217;t, from up there, give
motor-car and motor-car owner the reverence
rightly theirs. A thousand miles of horizontal
withdrawal into majestic forest recesses may
leave one&#8217;s regard for worldly greatness unabated.
A perpendicular vantage of a hundred
and fifty feet destroys it utterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But look at that!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In the east, dull red on the quick blue of Lake
Michigan, an ore-boat. Low and long. A marvelously
persistent and protracted boat. Might
have been christened <i>The Eel</i>. Or <i>The Projectile</i>.
No masts. And, except at her stern, under
her deferred smokestack, no portholes. Forward
from that stack her body stretched five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
hundred feet to her bow without excrescences
and without apertures. Stripped and shut-eyed
for the fight, grimmer than a battle ship, not a
waste line nor a false motion in her, she went by,
loaded with seven thousand tons of hematite,
down to the blast furnaces of South Chicago.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she said, &#8220;look at this.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned me from the lake. We crossed
the roof&#8217;s tarred gravel and looked north, west,
and south abroad at the city.</p>
<p>Puffs of energy had raised high buildings
over there; over there an eccentric subsidence
had left behind it a slum. Queer, curling currents
of trade and of lust, here, there, and everywhere,
were carrying little clutching eddies of
disease and of vice across the thoroughfares of
the wholesome and of the innocent. Sweet unused
earth lay yonder in a great curve of green;
within two miles of it stood clotted houses in
which children were dying for air; brown levels
of cottage and tenement, black bubbles of mill
and factory, floating side by side, meeting,
mingling, life and light merged into filth and
fume&mdash;uncalculated; uncontrolled; fortuitous
swirls and splutters on senseless molten metal;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
a reproduction in human lives of the phantom
flurry which on simmering ladles in the steel
mills they call the Devil&#8217;s Flower Garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so clever as the ore-boat, is it?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;That was making wealth, conquering. Well
done. This is using wealth, living. Done ill.
A city. Better than many. Worse than many.
But none of my business. I&#8217;m emancipated.&#8221;</p>
<p>She waved her hand and blotted out the city
from before me. In its place I saw now only an
uninhabited wilderness plain. In a moment,
however, in the side of a distant ridge, there appeared
a tiny opening. A woman sat near it,
plaiting a grass mat. A mile away a man stood,
mending a bow.</p>
<p>It was the scene Mr. Kipling once reported:</p>
<p>&#8220;The man didn&#8217;t begin to be tame till he met
the woman. She picked out a nice dry cave, instead
of a heap of wet leaves, to lie down in; and
she strewed clean sand on the floor; and she lit a
nice fire of wood at the back of the cave; and she
hung a dried wild-horse skin, tail down, across
the opening of the cave; and she said: &#8216;Wipe
your feet, dear, when you come in, and now we&#8217;ll
keep house.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>As we looked, we saw the man fit an arrow to
his bow, take aim, and bring down a deer. He
carried it to the cave. The woman rose to meet
him, the mat in her hand. He pushed her away
savagely, took the mat from her, and threw the
deer on the ground. She picked herself up and
began to skin the deer with a knife which she
slipped from her belt. He lay down on the mat
and went to sleep.</p>
<p>I heard my companion say: &#8220;<i>I</i> did all the
housekeeping of <i>that</i> camp. It was woman&#8217;s
work. But now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She waved her hand and restored the city to
my gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, of <i>this</i> camp <i>you</i> are the real housekeeper.
The arranging of it, the cleaning of it,
the decorating of it, on the big scale, as a total,
all masculine, all yours! How you have expanded
your duties, you who were once just
hunter and fighter, principally fighter! How
your sphere is swollen! You do not realize it.
You are familiar enough with the commonplace
fact that most primitive industry in its origin
owed little to you except (a big &#8216;except&#8217;) the
protection of your sword against enemies. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
are familiar with the fact that the plaiting of
mats and the tanning of hides and every other
industrial feature of housekeeping has passed
from my control to yours in precise proportion
as it has ceased to be individual and has become
collective. You dominate everything collective.
You understand that. What you don&#8217;t
understand is this:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not only the <i>industrial</i> features of
housekeeping which tend to become collective.
It is also its <i>administrative</i> features. I will give
you just one illustration. I cannot now keep
my premises clean, beautiful, livable, except
through the collective control of smoke, garbage,
billboards, noise. And that control is
yours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Further!</p>
<p>&#8220;Even the tenderer phases of housekeeping,
those which are more subtle than mere administration,
move steadily toward becoming yours.
I will give you an illustration of that. The
very children, now no longer always at their
mothers&#8217; knees, but spread abroad through
school and park and playground and street and
factory, are now much in your hands, for school
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
and park and playground and street and factory
are essentially controlled by you. You are increasingly
housekeeper, and even mother. You
not only control Working. You also control Living.
But who are you, you that now control
Living? You are&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She tapped my shoulder and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the Tired Business Man. Yes,
whether manufacturer, financier, scholar, or
poet, you are the Tired Business Man. You always
were. You still are. You are a fighter
still, by nature. You conquer steel and steam&mdash;and
make a boat that will carry a mountain of
ore. You conquer mounds of stock certificates
and masses of men&mdash;and organize armies for the
production of wealth. You conquer knowledge&mdash;and
write your treatise. You conquer the
sources of emotion&mdash;and write your poem. Then
you&#8217;re through. You lie down on your mat and
go to sleep. To be housekeeper, to be homemaker,
to take from each part of life its offerings
of value and patiently to weld them into a coherent,
livable whole&mdash;that is not your faculty.
You are a specialist. Produce, produce, produce&mdash;a
certain thing, a one certain thing, any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
one certain thing, from corkscrews to madonnas&mdash;you
can do it. But to make a city a home,
to elicit from discordant elements a harmonious
total of warm, charming, noble, livable life&mdash;you&#8217;ll
never do it, by yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you ask me to
help you a bit? Even aside from any special
qualities of my sex, don&#8217;t you know that the
greatest reserve fund of energy in any American
city to-day is the leisure and semi-leisure of certain
classes of its women?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they can give their leisure to &#8216;good
works&#8217; now if they want to,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but if they do that, they&#8217;ll
want to go farther. Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>And this is what she showed me&mdash;what she
told me:</p>

<p>Over there on Michigan Avenue, occupying
the whole front part of the ninth floor of the
Fine Arts Building, are the quarters of the
Chicago Woman&#8217;s Club. Twenty-seven years
ago, in the Brighton public school, northwest of
the Yards, that club started a kindergarten, providing

<p><span class='nowrap'>It was a &#8220;good work,&#8221;</span> one might think, quite
within &#8220;woman&#8217;s sphere.&#8221; But it wasn&#8217;t entered
into lightly and unadvisedly. In one of
the club&#8217;s old pamphlets you&#8217;ll find it set down
that Goethe had said that activity without insight
is an evil. Accordingly, the club had spent
its youth, from 1876 to 1883, reading, considering,
discussing. But certain topics were excluded.

<p>But kindergartens! Something for children!
Could anything be more womanly? So on the
fifth of December, 1883, the long-apprehended
question arose: &#8220;Shall Our Club Do Practical
Work?&#8221; There was much hesitation. But the
vote was affirmative.</p>
<p>Seems strange to-day, doesn&#8217;t it, that there
should have been any hesitation at all?</p>
<p>There beneath us, on the Lake Front, in the
Art Institute, on Sunday afternoons, there are
excellent orchestral concerts to which you will
be admitted on payment of ten cents. A work
of this club.</p>
<p>Out over the city, if your eyes could compass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
it, you would see a blind man going from place
to place, North Side, West Side, South Side,
seeking out other blind people, entering their
homes, teaching them how to read the books
published in Braille and Moon raised characters,
teaching them how to weave, teaching them
how to use the typewriter, teaching them even
how to make stenographic notes on a little keyboarded
machine which impresses raised characters
on a tape to be read off afterwards with
the finger tips, giving his fellow-dwellers in
darkness an occupation to be their solace, and
even an occupation to be their support. A work
of this club.</p>
<p>And the interval between these two kinds of
work could be filled up with hundreds of entries.
You have grown accustomed to all this. The
Chicago Woman&#8217;s Club, the scores of other
woman&#8217;s clubs in this city, the thousands in this
country&mdash;you expect them to be active. But you
do not perceive the consequences.</p>
<p>When the Chicago Woman&#8217;s Club started its
work in the Brighton School, there wasn&#8217;t any
such work in Chicago maintained by public
funds. The town&#8217;s pioneer kindergarten had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
been founded in 1867, by a woman. There had
then grown up an association called the Chicago
Froebel Association, which established and
operated kindergartens in public school buildings
out of its own resources. The Board of Education
provided space, but nothing more. The
Froebel Association was composed entirely of
women, and many of its members were also
members of the Chicago Woman&#8217;s Club. The
steam in the cylinders of the kindergarten movement
in Chicago was the enthusiasm of women.</p>
<p>Well, in 1892, the Board of Education took
the kindergartens over. The kindergarten system
became thoroughly public, civic, collective.
The control of it had lain with women. The
control of it now passed to men. Oh, there&#8217;s no
complaint. It&#8217;s what the women wanted. They
asked the men to do it. But I say&mdash;No, I&#8217;ll
postpone saying it till I&#8217;ve told you another story
or two.</p>
<p>In the late nineties the Chicago Woman&#8217;s
Club took the leading rle in the formation of
what was known as the Vacation Schools Committee.
More than sixty woman&#8217;s organizations
finally sent delegates to it. Its object was to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
give city-street children, in summer time, some
sort of experience resembling, if not reproducing,
the activity and the knowledge of nature
which comes with summer life in the country.</p>
<p>The vacation school, with its play and its nature
study, turned out to be both useful and
popular. For a decade or more the Vacation
Schools Committee, composed entirely of women,
raised large sums of money and extended its
efforts from school to school till there came to be
an established and recognized vacation schools
system. The women whose energy carried it forward
year after year were, in fact, school directors.
Now the vacation schools system has been
adopted by the Board of Education. Those
women are school directors no longer. Nor
have they any voice in the <i>selecting</i> of school
directors.</p>
<p>Almost immediately the women changed the
name of the Vacation Schools Committee to Permanent
School Extension Committee. Its objects
now are to extend the use of school buildings
and to extend the educational system itself.
Its work may be seen in many parts of town.</p>
<p>Ten miles to the south, near the mouth of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
Calumet River, where that ore-boat was turning
in, the &#8220;Johnson Cubs&#8221; and the &#8220;South Side
Stars&#8221; and other organizations of boys, principally
from the Thorp School, have been getting
manual training and football and cross-country
hikes and gymnastic skill under the direction of
a salaried representative of the Permanent
School Extension Committee, who has been trying
to make their hours out of school count for
something in their development.</p>

VACATION SCHOOLS.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>Southwest of us,</span> far over, back of the Yards,
at the Hamline School, for five years the Committee
has maintained a &#8220;social worker&#8221; who,
through clubs and classes and entertainments
and festivals in the evenings as well as in the
afternoons, for adults as well as for children, has
been trying to write over the doors of the school
the words which appear frequently enough elsewhere:
&#8220;Family Entrance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trifling? Dreamy? Just the sort of thing
woman&#8217;s club women would do? Well, it
seems to be about to lapse. But why? Because
the Board of Education, at last half-convinced,
has appropriated $10,000 for social-center work
of its own in the school buildings.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>The rest of the present work of the Permanent
School Extension Committee will lapse, too&mdash;in
time.</p>
<p>Last spring, in the Hamline School, for six
weeks eighteen children who needed the treatment
did their work in a room in which the windows
were kept open. The Permanent School
Extension Committee provided special chairs,
blankets, milk and eggs for morning and afternoon,
a hot meal for lunch.</p>
<p>During the summer, in three school yards&mdash;the
Lake View on the North Side, the Penn on
the West, the Libby on the South&mdash;there were
vacation schools for six weeks in the open air,
with special teaching and special feeding. The
Permanent School Extension Committee provided
the meals and the cooks.</p>
<p>The gain made in physical and mental condition
by the children so treated was such that the
time is sure to come when the principle of extra
air and extra food for below-par pupils, like the
principle of kindergartens, the principle of vacation
schools, and the principle of school social
centers, will be absorbed into the general policy
of the public school system.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>And now I will say the things I hesitated to
say a few moments ago.</p>
<p>First. Is it likely that women who have helped
to add element after element of value to the public
school system would fail to acquire an interest
in the public school system itself? Is it
likely that women who have had a voice in certain
important matters would relinquish all personal
concern about them immediately upon
their absorption into the city government? In
other words, is it strange that the topic of
woman&#8217;s suffrage is now tolerated on the floor of
the Chicago Woman&#8217;s Club?</p>
<p>Second. Might not one unwarily imagine that
among the women who for so many years have
given so much thought and action to school affairs
there would be found many whose experience
<i>and whose leisure</i> would be draughted
(with a press gang, if necessary) into the public
service?</p>
<p>Is it not strange that among the twenty-one
members of the Chicago Board of Education
only one is a woman? And doesn&#8217;t this become
still stranger when it is recollected that most
members of the Board of Education (to say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
nothing of their not having merited their appointment
by any notable benefits conferred on
the school system) are so overwhelmed by private
business as to find their attendance on board
committee meetings a hardship?</p>
<p>This last feature of the situation is the one that
more and more fills me with amazement. Here
is a woman whose acquaintance with educational
developments of all sorts is of long duration,
whose achievements in coperation with the
schools have been admittedly successful, whose
time, now that her children are grown up, is
much at her free disposal&mdash;here she is, working
away on the edges and fringes of the school system,
while some Tired Business Man is giving
the interstices of his commercial preoccupation
to the settlement of comprehensive questions of
educational policy.</p>
<p>But never mind. Things may change. The
present superintendent of schools is a woman.
That&#8217;s something. And, anyway, the women I
am speaking of, though increasingly conscious
of the degree of their exclusion from the collective
civic life of the town, do not spend so much
time in repining about it as they spend in seeking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
new opportunities for such civic service as is
possible to them.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is hard to say whether they are
within the bounds of private life or not.</p>
<p>If you will go up the Chicago River, up past
that bend, into the North Branch, up beyond
that gas plant where vagrant oils streak the surface
of the muddy water, vilely, vividly, with the
drifting hues of a lost and tangled rainbow, up
by factory and lumber yard, up into the
reaches of the open fields, till the straight
lines of wharves give way to tree-marked windings,
graceful bendings gracefully followed by
bending willows, you will come presently to a
school which tries to restore to city children
something of the peace and strength of the
country.</p>
<p>It is the Illinois Industrial School for Girls.
A few years ago it was in collapse&mdash;filthily
housed, educationally demoralized, heavily indebted.
A few women, principally from the
Chicago Woman&#8217;s Club, became interested in it.
They bought a farm for it. They put up buildings
for it. Not a big prison dormitory. Little
brick cottages. Matron in each one. Chance
for a kind of home life. Chance, also, for
instruction in housekeeping. Big vegetable
patches for instruction in gardening. Friendly
cows to help along with instruction in dairying.
Everything for outdoor life, working life, life
that engages and disciplines.</p>

THIS AND ABOVE: INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION FOR GIRLS.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>All the twenty-four</span> directors of this school
(with two exceptions) are women. Most of
them are members of the Chicago Woman&#8217;s
Club. One of the cottages is named after the
club. But the school is, in a way, a county institution.
That is, the county makes a certain contribution
to it, under a state law, for the support
of each girl committed to it as a dependent by
the Juvenile Court. The directors, therefore,
are trustees each year for a large amount of public
money.</p>
<p>Question: Are they in public life?</p>
<p>Answer: If the school is ever really owned by
the public, they will be discharged from public
life with extraordinary immediacy. The
way to deprive any enterprise of the possibility
of effective support from the female half
of the community is to give it to the community.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>No, I&#8217;ll admit that isn&#8217;t quite true. The
women do keep on trying to help.</p>
<p>How I wish I could make you see the whole
of this city, its streets, its vacant places, the inside
of its buildings, all, all at once, with all
the things happening which have been set going
by this Chicago Woman&#8217;s Club and by
the organizations with which it associates itself!</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see (and in each case you&#8217;d know that
what you were seeing was due either entirely or
very largely to the labors of the club, its committees,
its departments, or its close allies)&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see night matrons in the police stations
giving women arrests a degree of protection they
did not at one time have.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see in the Art Institute a line of pupils
who from year to year have passed through its
study rooms because of a certain scholarship
yearly offered.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see in the City Hall a new official called
the city forester, helping to save the trees the
town now has, issuing bulletins of professional
advice, giving his aid to the Arbor Day enthusiasm
which last year put some 400,000 seedlings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
into the parkways and private yards of
Chicago.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see, over the whole extent of the city,
local improvement associations, which on street
cleaning and other local needs, not adequately
met by the city government, spend a hundred
and fifty thousand dollars a year.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see, in the jail, a school for young men
prisoners, now taken over and supported by the
county, but still watched by the club. You&#8217;d
also see certain recent interests of the club: a
woman&#8217;s dining room, an examining physician
to segregate contagious diseases, a fumigating
plant.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see the paintings on the walls of the
assembly hall of the McKinley High School&mdash;the
first mural paintings in any school in Chicago.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see children, after school, in the park
playhouses, listening to &#8220;story ladies,&#8221; who tell
them fairy tales, historical tales, tales of adventure
and achievement.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see, in one of the small parks of the
West Side, a woman &#8220;social worker,&#8221; who gets
the mothers and fathers of the neighborhood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
into the way of using the park and the park
building, even for Christmas Eve family parties.
And then you&#8217;d see &#8220;social workers&#8221; appointed
by the park board itself and paid with
public money.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see, in many places, audiences listening
to free lectures on Social Hygiene.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see important excerpts from the city
code bearing on personal conduct being taken
into the newspaper offices to be printed under
the heading&mdash;&#8220;Ordinances You Ought to
Know.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see paintings and engravings being
hung in the public schools by the Public School
Art Society, till in a case such as that of the
Drake School the collection in a single school
building amounts in value to several thousand
dollars.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see wagonloads of coats and hats and
dresses and trousers being carried from the
School Children&#8217;s Aid Society to public schools
in all parts of the city, to be secretly conveyed to
boys and girls who otherwise could not come
through wintry weather to their lessons.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see flower gardens springing up in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
many school yards, after a little encouragement
and advice from the Women&#8217;s Outdoor Art
League.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d see a girl behind the walls of the Northwestern
University Building, over there on
Dearborn Street, telling her story of deception,
or of outrage, or of error, to the superintendent
of the Legal Aid Society. It used to be the
Women&#8217;s Protective Association till it was
merged with the Bureau of Justice a few years
since. It was initiated by the Chicago Woman&#8217;s
Club a generation ago. It has ministered to
thousands of young women cursed with that
curse both of God and of man which gives them,
however wronged, almost all the burden and
almost all the shame of the event. It is due
mainly to the work done here that in Illinois to-day
a girl cannot legally consent to her own undoing
till she is at least sixteen years old and
that even till she is eighteen her injurer, immune
from nature&#8217;s revenge, is not immune from
the law&#8217;s.</p>
<p>These things you&#8217;d see, and innumerable
others. All that I have mentioned have been
suggested to me by lines of communication
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
which stretch out over the town from the one
club I have particularly noted. If I tried to
unravel all those lines to all their endings, I
should keep you here beyond your patience. If
I tried to extend my survey to other similar
clubs, younger, smaller, but equally zealous, in
this community, I should keep you here even
beyond mine.</p>
<p>They began, those women of the Chicago
Woman&#8217;s Club, with remembering that Goethe
said that activity without insight is an evil.
Last spring they remembered something else
that Goethe said. Their president, retiring
from office, comprehended the history of the
club and of thousands of other woman&#8217;s clubs
thus:</p>
<p>&#8220;Goethe, who started with the theory that
the highest life was to be gained by self-culture,
in later years concluded that service was the
way to happiness. So we have risen by stepping
stones to higher things; through study, through
<i>interest</i> in humanity, the supreme motive of this
club has come to be <i>service</i> to humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet I haven&#8217;t mentioned the greatest service
ever rendered to the town by its women.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>One day a woman went on a visit, one of many,
to the jail. There were a lot of boys playing
about a man in a dressing-gown and rocking-chair.
She inquired about him. &#8220;Him?&#8221; said
the children, &#8220;He&#8217;s a fellow just murdered his
wife. He&#8217;s our boss.&#8221;</p>
<p>Visits like that, scenes like that, were the beginning
of the Juvenile Court in Chicago. As
the idea began to traverse the local sky, it gathered
about it a most useful and honorable aura
of masculine interest. But the nucleus of it was
feminine. And it is to women that the United
States really owes its first Juvenile Court law.</p>
<p>The incident might end there and be notable
enough. But it goes farther.</p>
<p>At the very first session of the Chicago Juvenile
Court there appeared two women. One of
them offered to be a probation officer. The
other, with a consciousness of many friends
behind her, offered to accumulate a fund on
which a staff of probation officers might be
maintained.</p>
<p>From those offers grew the Juvenile Court
Committee. Its work during the next eight years
was an integral part of the administration of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
Juvenile Court. There&#8217;s little wisdom (in a
city as large as Chicago) in paroling a wayward
boy unless there&#8217;s a probation officer to follow
him, to watch him, to encourage him, to keep
him from relapsing into the hands of the judge.
Some 3,500 children pass through the court
every year. The judge cannot be father to many
of them. The probation officers are the judge&#8217;s
eyes and hands, giving him knowledge and
control of his family. Without the probation
officers the new system would have been an amiable
reform, but not an effective agency for
juvenile regeneration.</p>
<p>The Juvenile Court Committee developed a
staff of probation officers, which finally had
twenty-two members. The Juvenile Court
Committee also undertook the maintenance and
management of the detention home in which
boys were sheltered and instructed while awaiting
the final disposition of their cases. The
Juvenile Court Committee also gave time and
money to many other features of the development
of the court, all the way from paying the
salaries of a chief clerk and a chief stenographer
to suggesting the advisability and securing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
adoption of necessary amendments to the Juvenile
Court law.</p>
<p>From the year 1898 to the year 1907 the Juvenile
Court Committee raised and spent $100,000.
But it did its best work in depriving itself of
its occupation. It secured the passage of a law
which established the probation officer system
as part of the Juvenile Court system, to be maintained
forever by the county authorities. And
it succeeded, after long negotiations, in persuading
the county and the city governments to
coperate in the erection of a Children&#8217;s Building,
which houses both the court and the detention
home.</p>
<p>The original purpose of the Juvenile Court
Committee was now fulfilled. The Committee
perished. But it immediately rose from its ashes
as the Juvenile Protective Association. Instead
of supporting <i>probation</i> officers to look after
children who are <i>already</i> in the care of the court,
it now spends some $25,000 a year on <i>protective</i>
officers, who have it for their ultimate object to
prevent children from <i>getting into</i> the care of
the court. Can anything be done to dam the
stream of dependent and delinquent children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
which flows through the children&#8217;s building so
steadily? What are the subterranean sources of
that stream? Can they be staunched?</p>
<p>The managers of the Juvenile Protective Association,
in going back of the court to study the
home lives, the industrial occupations, and the
amusements which form the characters, for better
or for worse, of the city&#8217;s children, are approaching
the field in which the causes of social
corruption will stand much more clearly revealed
than at present to our intelligence and
conscience. It is fundamental work.</p>
<p>But what of the women who are directing that
work? What of the women who are directing
the other enterprises I have mentioned? Would
they make good citizens?</p>
<p>They are militant citizens now, <i>with the rank
of noncombatants</i>.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>We crossed the roof&#8217;s tarred gravel once more,
and once more leaned over the tiled parapet and
looked abroad at the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that women cannot
give their leisure to useful activity without verging
toward citizenship. That is the rule. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
are exceptions, caused by individual temperament.
But that is the rule. Make one group
of the women who use their leisure to <i>good</i> purpose.
Make another of the women who use their
leisure to <i>no</i> purpose. You&#8217;ll find a growing desire
for citizenship in the former. You&#8217;ll find
little such desire in the latter. The conflict that
is going on among women who have any leisure
at all is between the spirit which drives them toward
a union with the life of the world and the
spirit which drives them toward complete detachment
and irresponsibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;So let&#8217;s say no more about the suffrage agitation.
It&#8217;s simply a sequel to women&#8217;s interest in
the world&#8217;s housekeeping. The broader question
is, &#8216;Will that interest grow?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;One would think it could hardly help growing.
The hosts of women who are earning their
living&mdash;they are immersed in the world even
as men. But the women who are at home,
with little children about them! They&#8217;re abstracted
from the world, aren&#8217;t they? Yes,
<i>physically</i>, just as much as ever. But <i>mentally</i>
they come closer and closer to the world all
the time.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Have you read the Home Economics books?
The day is coming, you know, when every girl
will have the training those books suggest. It
will make her a home woman, you say. Yes, it
will help do that. But it will help even more
to make her something else, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that the Home Economics
literature has more in it about civic service than
any other one general kind of educational literature
you can lay your hands on?</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that seem odd to you? I&#8217;ll tell you the
reason for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Home Economics is the study of Right Living,
the study of the importance, the utility, and
the possible beauty of the common things of
daily existence. Now one cannot study sanitation,
fresh air, pure food, adequate housing, the
care of children, the protection of the family
from disease, the maintenance of a proper environment
and regimen for health and efficiency,
without instantly perceiving the closeness of the
relationship between the life of the individual
and the life of the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;The so-called bread-and-butter studies, now
being inserted into women&#8217;s education, have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
merit, superficially paradoxical, of raising the
mind to the duties of citizenship. The simplest
mother, immured in her home with her small
children, will in the days to come realize, as she
does not now at all realize, what the freshness of
the milk supply, what the purity of the city
water, what the efficiency of the health department,
mean to those children. She will know&mdash;and
when she knows she will care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me give you one illustration of the extent
to which certain teachers of Home Economics
recognize the future civic responsibilities of
their pupils.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a little town far up in the Northwest
there&#8217;s a famous Homemakers&#8217; School. It is far
from the social pressure of packed populations.
Nevertheless, along with all the housekeeping
details which crowd its two-year course, you&#8217;ll
find a series of lectures on &#8216;Home and Social
Economics&#8217; based on a theory which I&#8217;ll try to
give in almost the very words used by the school
itself in its public announcements of policy. It&#8217;s
this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The growing wealth of different communities,
the application of modern inventions to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
home industries, the passing of many of the
former lines of women&#8217;s work into the factory
have brought to many women leisure time which
should be spent in social service. Civic cleanliness,
the humane treatment of children, the city
beautiful, education, civic morality, the protection
of children from immoral influences, child
labor, the organizations to protect neglected
children and to reform delinquent children&mdash;all
are legitimately within the province of
motherhood, and the attempt to improve conditions
is a part of the duty of the modern
woman.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that radical? Surely not. Surely it&#8217;s conservative.
There&#8217;s not a suggestion in it of any
change in woman&#8217;s interests. There&#8217;s only an
awakening to the fact that her interests are now
diffused throughout the community, that what
could once be comprehended in a wilderness
cave is now spread abroad through all the lands
of all the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I taught housekeeping in that cave. I
wonder if I could teach better housekeeping to
the whole world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I could if I would. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking now of the millions of women
who, after all their home duties are done, still
have some time they could give me for a more
livable world life. Will they? I can&#8217;t say. But
I will say this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Either their public spirit will grow or their
private character will decline. One of the two.
Because they carry, along with that leisure of
theirs, not only its blessings but also its curse.
They must sanctify it or perish by it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leisure! Culture! Emancipation! All
nothing unless there is something more. Culture
without action is an ingrowing disease
which first debilitates and then dissolves the will
to live. Emancipation without duty is a mirage
of pleasure which raises thirst but never
quenches it. The Romans emancipated their
women, in the days of their degeneration, but
with no result except a completer collapse of
family life and of personal virtue.</p>
<p>&#8220;But perhaps there will be a new issue of
events this time. It looks as if there might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;That weary ancient world, recoiling from its
luxuries, its dissipations, its surfeits, turned to
pessimistic mysticism, to the theory that the flesh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
and the things of the flesh are vile, to monastic
withdrawal into the desert and the mountains,
to the life of inward searchings.</p>
<p>&#8220;This modern world is turning to optimistic
materialism, to the theory that the flesh and the
things of the flesh can be made noble, to anti-tuberculosis
societies and juvenile courts, to the
life of outward workings.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>That</i> world found peace in <i>renunciation</i>.
<i>This</i> world seeks peace in <i>service</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is going to be an era of the importance,
the utility, and the possible beauty of the common
things of daily existence. It is going to be
an era of Right Living.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will not woman have a <i>particular</i> part in
it? May she not even have a <i>dominant</i> part
in it?</p>
<p>&#8220;I have watched her every hour from the beginning&mdash;from
the very first beginning of any
life that had any warmth of love in it. I have
seen her make the hearth the symbol of the stability
of the individual life. Now, when the
duties of the home, the stones of which that
hearth was made, are scattered far and wide,
shall I not see her reassemble them on a grander
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
scale to make a total of stability for all life whatsoever?
Shall I not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who?&#8221; I said, &#8220;who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am the spirit that made
woman love her child, and that shall yet make
her love her kind.&#8221;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
